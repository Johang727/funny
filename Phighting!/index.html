<p>This is the "cool" webpage I made for a programming class years ago. The webpage is quite subpar, as I have no idea how to do web programming, but I made minimal changes to make it look a little better. All of the stats (I think) as well as almost all of the images are taken from the Phighting! Fandom, now the <a href="https://phighting.wiki" class="wiki">phighting.wiki</a>, and the "Press a key" image as well as all of the gifs were made by me.<br>Also note that since this is almost 2 years old it is insanely outdated (back when Vine Staff wasn't released yet!)</p>
