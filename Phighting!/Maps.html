<tr class="maps maphead"><th class="maphead">Map Name</th><th class="maphead">Gamemodes</th><th class="maphead">Rating out of 10</th><th class="maphead">Description of map</th></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map banland">Banland</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br></td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☺☺☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">Banland is a cool map, with many high places for snipers and many lanes for ambushes. Center has a bit of cover that can be used as high ground. Lava can be a little annoying, but can be used as an advantage for Phighters with knockback. There are three different ways to go to the other side, with one of them being the central point of the map.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map bogpark">BOGIO Skatepark</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br>Conquer</td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">BOGIO Skatepark is a very good map, with so much cover and high ground that it somehow doesn't interfere with melee Phighters. The point has a grated wall that hitscan projectiles can go through, and some cover in the form of some stone pillars.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map chscnyn">Chaos Canyon</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br></td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☺☺☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">Cool map with the train gimmick from Train Demolition, can be annoying to navigate due to huge cover areas. Has some good high ground, but view is obscured by cover enough to deter snipers.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map darkclf">Darkage Cliffs</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br>Conquer</td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">Great map, has a lot of high ground for snipers (and Katana apparently?!?) and good open space for melee. The map is very open, so there aren't many restrictions to mobility. Cool fire shoots from spots when 1 minute is left.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map dodgbal">DODGEBALL!</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br></td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☺☺☺☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">This map is a very unique map, as when chosen it can be one of two versions. One has many obstacles for impeding movement (good for melee) and one has an open center with some high ground (good for ranged).</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map dmnovly">Domino Valley</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br></td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☺☺☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">Domino Valley is a cool map, as there is no shortage of cover and wide open areas. Spawncamping is expected upon playing this map. The high ground is easily accessible from spawn, and has most of the aforementioned cover, in the form of one large castle each side.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map dmspire">Doomspire</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br>Conquer</td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☺☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">Doomspire is a fun map with the gimmick of a plane to instakill unsuspecting Phighters. The existence of an under-the-point area gives many opportunities to Subspaces and Medkits (for healing in cover). There is also high ground for snipers.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map htelpht">Hotel Elephant</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br></td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☺☺☺☺☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">Hotel Elephant is a map that has a lot of high ground. There is also no shortage of low ground, too. Cover is plentiful in this map, as there are many, many decorations. However, due to the excessive cover, playing ranged is a nightmare. The map is also very small. The stage's gimmick is that there are also conveyor belts that are all over the map. This map is best for melee Phighters.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map kofthil">King of the Hill</th><td class="maps"><br>Conquer</td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☺☺☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">King of the Hill is a very nice map, as it employs the King of the Hill map concept with its own twist. There are many stones and pillars littered about the map, acting as cover to help retake the point, as there is no cover in the point (except for the thin flagpole). AoE Phighters will excel at this map.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map nktwhle">Nuke the Whakes</th><td class="maps"><br>Conquer</td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☺☺☺☺☺☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">Nuke the Whales is a very intresting map. It is a conquer exclusive, so the main level gimmick revolves around the point. The center will rise throughout the match, and it will get more difficult to retake the point. There is high ground at the beginning of the match, but that changes to low ground quickly. When you get knocked off the point, it is really frusterating due to the "air thrusters" (really trampolines) as they bounce you lower over time making you wait to get back up. There is also too much stuff in the point, which isn't big enough for a fun phight.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map ptctlmn">Protect Telamon</th><td class="maps"><br>Conquer</td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☺☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">Protect Telamon is by far the most open Conquer map in the entire game. There are two short roads that lead to the point from spawn, and the point is a slightly raised circular stone slab. This map appeals to all classes due to the plethora of high and open ground.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map rtrbxbk">Rob the ROBLOX Bank</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br></td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☺☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">Rob the ROBLOX Bank will appeal to strategists, due to the plethora of pathways for travel around the map. There is high, low and mid ground, and no shortage of cover. Melee Phighters are good for this map due to how close everything is, and ranged is good support.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map rbloxhq">ROBLOX HQ</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br></td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☺☺☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">ROBLOX HQ is a map that is in the air, which means if you fall off, you're dead. There is a top path and a bottom path, with many ways to switch paths present. There is also a safety net at the bottom of the bottom path to skillfully land on if you fell off the paths.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map rxlndmt">ROBLOX Laundromat</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br></td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☺☺☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">ROBLOX Laundromat is a cool design for a map, as the high ground allows easy access to low ground, and vice versa. The stage gimmick here is that the low ground will flood in 1 minute remaining, dealing immense damage to whoever finds themself in the water. There are many ledges for Skateboards, and cover is around the middle.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map rbxmall">ROBLOX Mall</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br>Conquer</td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☺☺☺☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">ROBLOX Mall is a huge map reminiscent of the size of the old BOGIO Skatepark. The center is only accessible in a small number of ways, and is hard to get to. Mainly, the map attracts spawncamping, as it is the easiest way as the spawns are scattered around the map.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map rxmseum">ROBLOX Museum</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br></td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☺☺☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">ROBLOX Museum is a giant 2-floor map with many rooms to get lost in. The main room (the center) has many things in it, and the hallways to access it are covered by moveable solid banners. The second floor is very prone to melee vs. ranged.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map rktarna">Rocket Arena</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br></td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">Rocket Arena is one of the only map in the game that changes in time with the music. Every transition in the music co-ordinates to a day-night change in the game, with the night adding conveyors. The map becomes night forever when 1 minute remaining happens. There are a lot of places where you can get knocked off in this map.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map swdfoth">Sword Fights on the Heights</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br>Conquer</td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☺☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">Sword Fights on the Heights has many places for snipers and crowd control characters. The point is always packed in this map. There are many conveyors and bridges, as well as trampolines around the map that are used for mobility.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map spckngt">Space Knights</th><td class="maps"><br>Conquer</td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">Space Knights is one of the most fun to play maps in the game. The point has a lot of cover around it, and there are many places to battle outside. The point itself has a big intangible tube that you can hide in (but not effectively). The point is also raised slightly, giving small cover in the depressions in the stairs going up to the point.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map bdfctry">The Bread Factory</th><td class="maps"><br>Conquer</td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">The Bread Factory is a cool map with a cool gimmick, as the center has a large press that insta-kills players when it presses down. You can get on the press and get pushed into the roof for temporary cover if you need it.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map irncafe">The Iron Cafe</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br>Conquer</td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">The Iron Cafe is a small map, but it's very fun because all the action is concentrated in the point most of the time. This leads to good opportunities for crowd control characters like Rocket and Skateboard. There is also an upper floor for ranged Phighters that is also fun to phight on.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map undergw">The Underground War</th><td class="maps"><br>Conquer</td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☺☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">The Underground War is what it says in the title: it's completely underground. The point is pretty far from spawn, making it irritating to go to when playing as a phighter with poor mobility. The point is enclosed with a bunch of sloped rocks, giving ranged phighters a good angle of attack, and there is some cover in the point in the form of many minecarts. A popular area for ranged characters is just outside of the point, as it is a side view compared to a top-down perspective, giving more of a chance to hit an enemy.</div></td></tr>
<tr class="maps"><th class="map trndmlt">Train Demolition</th><td class="maps">Annihilate<br></td><td class="maps rating">☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☺</td><td class="maps"><div class="stupidtablehasnooverflowscroll">Train Demolition has a very annoying stage gimmick: the train tracks on both sides of the map usually have a paassing train inhabiting it and although it makes for good cover, it is also somewhat hard to go to the center when there is a train blocking your way. The trains can also rush through and instakill any phighter that gets hit by it. There is a large amount of cover and elevated spaces in the map, but the center is completely flat, allowing for a fair and fun phight.</div></td></tr>
