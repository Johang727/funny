/* heyo, i have a serious problem with this stupid physics library. in
roblox, every object is its own object in the world, being manipulatable
through many functions accessible even if the function is of another object
but fisica. ohohoho. how the heck do i even use this thing. so every object
in fisica, i add to the world after creating it instead of it just being
created into the world, then i can also add it more than 1 time and it
makes the same object in the world but not at the same time? its just so
different from roblox.
oh yaya, i think i figured it out a little better now. i know now to never
use arrays with these as they dont work, so i guess i gotta learn arraylist
to have arrays.
