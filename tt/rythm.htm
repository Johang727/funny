ATTACKS (i needed this section so bad that i wrote this whole webpage for it)<BR>
<H1>LMB: Rhythm Shot</H1> (better name pending)<BR>
Rhythmgunner shoots a shot from his speaker cassette tape rig thing and it's so amplified that it comes out as a mass like a bullet from a gun. If you shoot again shortly after his rig is programmed like a cd player to shoot automatically at that same tempo/beat/rhythm. also does extra damage as an incentive to do so.
<H1>RMB: i forgot so heres a placeholder</H1><BR>
since i forgot what this attack was supposed to be after i wrote it down on a piece of paper im just gonna say for now that rhythmguy here forgot to press the program button on his cassette player so it doesnt do the auto thing and the extra damage.
