/*jan6 heehee. this titles kinda funny. anyways this new project is like a
little testing grounds for 3d. except the camera controls are horrid. who
designed it so that it points to a point and not to a direction? why not
make both instead of this(probably)nonstandard way? and the cubes and balls
must be positioned with translate? huh? i guess i gotta write my own
functions to draw those primitives. also since this is the latest project
the previous rant document is officially discontinued. although thats not
much of a surprise methinks. also i gotta write more functions to translate
vectors because camera pan left and right are actually up and down which is
not right.

jan9 meowin wows this 3d stuff is a lot easier than i thought it would be.
maybe its because i have so much experience with roblox studio being
unproductive or because of how much i experimented with cframes. i really
gotta find an easy way to find out the absolute position of the first pixel
on screen it tho so i can get rid of that stupid wait 2 frames for mouse to
initialize thing. anyways you might have noticed that i have made a kitta
theme in the root folder of this sketch. if you try it out itll either melt
your eyes or be a pleasant teal colour with the cool gradients and nearly
unreadable console output text. speaking of nearly unreadable this comment
text is barely readable to me when im typing it out cause the line is dim
but the comments are also dim. but i think it looks pretty nice. now for
something that i found out recently. apparently inner kitta is called a
tulpa and i had no idea. i accidentally created several tulpas cause i was
lonely and i wanted my characters to be very fleshed out. oopsies. i guess
inner kittas gonna be called kittulpa here. im still just gonna call her
kitta in my mind though. that will never change until i think of a nickname
like kitts or somethin.

jan14 hehe schoolwork has really crushed my ability to work hard on my
programmin stuff lately. i sincerely hope that i will have more time to
work on my garbage because it makes me happy. working on stuff like this
really relaxes me and makes me satisfied when i get something to work.

i havent even realised that now tophat turmoil is about 1500 lines of code.
the rest of them are either whitespace or comments i know for a fact. that
is my way of coding.

jan15 i remember when i used to play phighting like every day. now i dont
even care about the boombox rework. i liked phighting back when i played it
with the old smg medkit and the full map selection available instead of
hourly rotations and the no sword events and the old bogio skatepark and
space knights and roblox mall and banland i miss it. now i guess im gonna
work on tophat turmoil all day.

also im gonna make kittas theme on the genesis a lot less drummy. too much
noise! the simpleness of the opll version is really much better. also i
gotta export the new revision again cause it sounds much better now. and i
just remembered that roblox is increasing the friends limit now. i was
quite surprised to see 201 friends on my list for the first time. not that
im gonna start accepting any request again but its cool.

i really feel like doing nothing right now. i dont know what to do even
with Kitta explicitly telling me what to do.

jan21 i have forgotten to push my changes from another computer again. wee.
i have finally figured out why long lines distort in p3d. the renderer uses
a very thin tri to draw the line, but when the length is long enough, the
length to thickness ratio causes the line to be thick. in an extreme case,
it can fill the entire screen. so i guess the way to do it now is to avoid
using extremely long lines. i am gonna work on tophat turmoil a lot more
starting february so im probably gonna abandon processing or something. but
i will work on that genesis game until march. so at least thats something.

at this point i should just make a blog on my github pages. if i formatted
all of my rants to be 75 characters wide like this one id probably have
like 1000 lines or something like that. thats 75000 characters for an
estimated 12500 words with 1 word = 5 letters + a space. but thats only my
guess. i hate the new outlook. it replaces my favourite mail app windows
mail just because microsoft wasnt making enough money having an ad free and
extremely quick simple mail app as an alternative to the ad ridden slow web
browser of an app. good thing the only thing i have to do is to uninstall
outlook every time it reinstalls to use the old mail. even better, i can
just disable the windows store because it is rather useless and cut outlook
from being downloaded in the first place. i even prefer outlook classic to
the new outlook. theres a reason why i nicknamed the new outlook $#!+look.

jan25 i have finally rid myself of that stupid new outlook. i just gotta
downgrade mail and disable autoupdates of store apps and voila i get the
better mail client.
