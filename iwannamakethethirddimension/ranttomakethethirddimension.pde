/*jan6 heehee. this titles kinda funny. anyways this new project is like a
little testing grounds for 3d. except the camera controls are horrid. who
designed it so that it points to a point and not to a direction? why not
make both instead of this(probably)nonstandard way? and the cubes and balls
must be positioned with translate? huh? i guess i gotta write my own
functions to draw those primitives. also since this is the latest project
the previous rant document is officially discontinued. although thats not
much of a surprise methinks. also i gotta write more functions to translate
vectors because camera pan left and right are actually up and down which is
not right.
