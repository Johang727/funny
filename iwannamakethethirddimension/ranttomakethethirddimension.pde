/*jan6 heehee. this titles kinda funny. anyways this new project is like a
little testing grounds for 3d. except the camera controls are horrid. who
designed it so that it points to a point and not to a direction? why not
make both instead of this(probably)nonstandard way? and the cubes and balls
must be positioned with translate? huh? i guess i gotta write my own
functions to draw those primitives. also since this is the latest project
the previous rant document is officially discontinued. although thats not
much of a surprise methinks. also i gotta write more functions to translate
vectors because camera pan left and right are actually up and down which is
not right.

jan9 meowin wows this 3d stuff is a lot easier than i thought it would be.
maybe its because i have so much experience with roblox studio being
unproductive or because of how much i experimented with cframes. i really
gotta find an easy way to find out the absolute position of the first pixel
on screen it tho so i can get rid of that stupid wait 2 frames for mouse to
initialize thing. anyways you might have noticed that i have made a kitta
theme in the root folder of this sketch. if you try it out itll either melt
your eyes or be a pleasant teal colour with the cool gradients and nearly
unreadable console output text. speaking of nearly unreadable this comment
text is barely readable to me when im typing it out cause the line is dim
but the comments are also dim. but i think it looks pretty nice. now for
something that i found out recently. apparently inner kitta is called a
tulpa and i had no idea. i accidentally created several tulpas cause i was
lonely and i wanted my characters to be very fleshed out. oopsies. i guess
inner kittas gonna be called kittulpa here. im still just gonna call her
kitta in my mind though. that will never change until i think of a nickname
like kitts or somethin.
