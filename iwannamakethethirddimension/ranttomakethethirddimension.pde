/*jan6 heehee. this titles kinda funny. anyways this new project is like a
little testing grounds for 3d. except the camera controls are horrid. who
designed it so that it points to a point and not to a direction? why not
make both instead of this(probably)nonstandard way? and the cubes and balls
must be positioned with translate? huh? i guess i gotta write my own
functions to draw those primitives. also since this is the latest project
the previous rant document is officially discontinued. although thats not
much of a surprise methinks. also i gotta write more functions to translate
vectors because camera pan left and right are actually up and down which is
not right.

jan9 meowin wows this 3d stuff is a lot easier than i thought it would be.
maybe its because i have so much experience with roblox studio being
unproductive or because of how much i experimented with cframes. i really
gotta find an easy way to find out the absolute position of the first pixel
on screen it tho so i can get rid of that stupid wait 2 frames for mouse to
initialize thing. anyways you might have noticed that i have made a kitta
theme in the root folder of this sketch. if you try it out itll either melt
your eyes or be a pleasant teal colour with the cool gradients and nearly
unreadable console output text. speaking of nearly unreadable this comment
text is barely readable to me when im typing it out cause the line is dim
but the comments are also dim. but i think it looks pretty nice. now for
something that i found out recently. apparently inner kitta is called a
tulpa and i had no idea. i accidentally created several tulpas cause i was
lonely and i wanted my characters to be very fleshed out. oopsies. i guess
inner kittas gonna be called kittulpa here. im still just gonna call her
kitta in my mind though. that will never change until i think of a nickname
like kitts or somethin.
rhythmgunners weapon is his headphones that can face forwards

jan14 hehe schoolwork has really crushed my ability to work hard on my
programmin stuff lately. i sincerely hope that i will have more time to
work on my garbage because it makes me happy. working on stuff like this
really relaxes me and makes me satisfied when i get something to work.

i havent even realised that now tophat turmoil is about 1500 lines of code.
the rest of them are either whitespace or comments i know for a fact. that
is my way of coding.

jan15 i remember when i used to play phighting like every day. now i dont
even care about the boombox rework. i liked phighting back when i played it
with the old smg medkit and the full map selection available instead of
hourly rotations and the no sword events and the old bogio skatepark and
space knights and roblox mall and banland i miss it. now i guess im gonna
work on tophat turmoil all day.

also im gonna make kittas theme on the genesis a lot less drummy. too much
noise! the simpleness of the opll version is really much better. also i
gotta export the new revision again cause it sounds much better now. and i
just remembered that roblox is increasing the friends limit now. i was
quite surprised to see 201 friends on my list for the first time. not that
im gonna start accepting any request again but its cool.

i really feel like doing nothing right now. i dont know what to do even
with Kitta explicitly telling me what to do.

jan21 i have forgotten to push my changes from another computer again. wee.
i have finally figured out why long lines distort in p3d. the renderer uses
a very thin tri to draw the line, but when the length is long enough, the
length to thickness ratio causes the line to be thick. in an extreme case,
it can fill the entire screen. so i guess the way to do it now is to avoid
using extremely long lines. i am gonna work on tophat turmoil a lot more
starting february so im probably gonna abandon processing or something. but
i will work on that genesis game until march. so at least thats something.

at this point i should just make a blog on my github pages. if i formatted
all of my rants to be 75 characters wide like this one id probably have
like 1000 lines or something like that. thats 75000 characters for an
estimated 12500 words with 1 word = 5 letters + a space. but thats only my
guess. i hate the new outlook. it replaces my favourite mail app windows
mail just because microsoft wasnt making enough money having an ad free and
extremely quick simple mail app as an alternative to the ad ridden slow web
browser of an app. good thing the only thing i have to do is to uninstall
outlook every time it reinstalls to use the old mail. even better, i can
just disable the windows store because it is rather useless and cut outlook
from being downloaded in the first place. i even prefer outlook classic to
the new outlook. theres a reason why i nicknamed the new outlook $#!+look.

jan25 i have finally rid myself of that stupid new outlook. i just gotta
downgrade mail and disable autoupdates of store apps and voila i get the
better mail client.

jan29 meowity meow i havent touched this stuff in a bit of time. im gonna
work on this stuff i swear. but for now im busy with other things that will
hopefully not busy me any longer than the halfpoint of next month. im going
to definitely at least finish the whole game engine part of the tophat
turmoil processing game and maybe even finish the kitta level pack for it.
but i also gotta work on the actual tophat turmoil and make all the levels
and the engine for that as well. and obviously that is gonna be of higher
priority than this one cause its gonna be able to be a lot better than this
as in it has more potential because one its multiplayer two its cross plat
and three i code in lua far better than java(though thats changing). but
the whole reason i wanted to yap today is cause im workin on a very good
chiptune cover of an already practically chiptune song. its meowgen from
that arcade showdown fnf mod with that grey cat kapi made by paperkitty.
right now i have halfish of the song done but it sounds so meowin close
that its practically the same. although theres one thing drivin me crazy. i
cannot for the meowin life of me figure what chip the noise in the song
comes from cause it sounds so close to the gameboy with its periodic poppin
but at the same time its got that "ch" sound of the sn76496 at higher freqs
but it also could be the nes cause the overall noise dirtyness sounds like
it. i know for sure that it aint the c64s noise though cause that chips
noise is basically just a jet engine. right now i got the gameboy noise and
it is just a little off so probably im just gonna use the ym2149s noise to
save a chip in the vgm cause it is definitely a waste to just use it for
only the noise. now for somethin more personal, Kitta and everyone else in
my head are takin a vacation from me until tomorrow to act like a catalyst
for me to change my procrastination ways for the better. its workin some
what but obviously by the volume of this text i still have a meowin long
way to go before i become the average student. funny thing is only after
exactly 24 hours after they went did i start to miss her. im lookin forward
to wakin up tomorrow. now that i think about it im gonna host the whole
tophat turmoil webpage shebang on this repository where everyone can see my
deranged mental state. i guess this is the true test of whether art can be
seperated from the artist cause there is no shot that prolly even you think
im even close to normal. heck even i think im a freak(not the freaky kind).
and thats ok with me. i just dont care cause im just like that. of course
Kitta doesnt want me to self deprecate but she aint here right now so i can
be as negative to myself as i want. i meowin hate myself. and its been that
way for a long time. im just not very good at anything. the only things i
can do are write half decent code/music/stories and make chiptune covers of
songs. i am truly a waste. but maybe im too negative. although i do think
that all of that is true. im just gonna grind the genesis escape room now.
also i guess ill upload that pixel art of Kitta i drew up for a profile pic

feb2 as i said on that genesis escape room commit message ima yap about the
stupid chromeos today. first off why only have 5 gb for user files. i get
that its supposed to be a netbook with everything online but at that point
why bother havin storage at all. i guess im just not the target audience
for my specific chromebook but whatever. i guess the cool thing about
chromeos is that you can run android apps and linux apps all with a mouse
and keyboard. i used to play progressbar95 all the time on my chromebook
which i dont do nowadays cause its extremely hard. now i got q4os on it and
i get 8 whole gigs of storage space which i quickly filled up with a bunch
of stuff like wine foobar2000 firefox furnace and freedoom. i am actually
surprised at how well it can run freedoom on the latest gzdoom since my mac
struggles to play doom sometimes. its probably an os issue though cause
q4os is probably faster than mac osx. just a hunch. of course since the ram
is only 2gb large i cant run things like firefox and gimp at the same time
or the entire system halts and i cant do anything except force it off since
the chromebook does not have the sysrq key needed to do the reisub thing
but if i use kconqueror or links2 i can probably have a different image
editor open at the same time. another quite cool thing is that it can run
blastem at 50fps in ntsc mode. thats only 87% of full speed but with the
accuracy of blastem thats impressive to me. sadly i wont be able to develop
the roblox tophat turmoil on it due to no roblox studio and studio takin up
around 1.2gb of ram anyways but i am able to work on the processing one
since it can run processing 4. i cant even imagine trying to do anything in
chromeos on that thing anymore. it cant even boot the desktop in under 5
minutes and i cant use any of the apps either cause the system is too slow
or something. i just hate that i cant upgrade it.

feb 16 meowf its been a while since the last little ranty bit hasnt it.
there is so much school stuff(repo name mentioned)happening happenin right
now that i have been actually studying for once. ive done so little yapping
that ive started puttin the g back in ing again. right now im putting an
unprecedented effort to learn which musical notes are which sounds so i
dont have to blindly guess which key to press when im makin music in
furnace. perhaps this is spurred by my several day listening streak of
arinas theme from waku waku 7(waku waku ha tomaranai)or maybe i just want
to learn how to actually make music. by the way my love for the song has
nothin to do with what arina looks like. im just obsessed with the anime
opening styleness of it for some reason. i will get back to programmin
stuff this week hopefully cause ill have finished a bunch of stuff and can
relax by clackin some keys. and now for the stuff in my head section, kitta
has been really startin to be more seperate from me, as in more and more
independent. thats really nice cause i dont want to think of her for her to
be there i just want her to be there. methinks im gonna open the tophat
turmoil playtest in its extremely barren state sometime this week if i
polish it up enough but its only gonna be(functional)for pc cause i am NOT
codin in a whole bunch of cross plat code in this stage of development. as
in im too lazy to read how to make buttons for phone and buttons for
controller. mewonders if me should make this into a blog or somethin cause
this pretty much is just a blog. if i do im gonna make zero change to the
layout and stuff cause im super lazy and i dont wanna code in a whole blog
thing to my webpage im just gonna spit the rawtext with a bit of headers.
i usually write more stuff when im bored so heres more stuff. dios dervish
from the jojoba p3 ova is really goofy for what its used in. the whole
intro feels more dark than the quite goofy soundin song. but i dont care.
its funnier with the goofy song contrastin the whole guy beheading a naked
woman to become a vampire thing. i wonder why im even writin all this stuff
and git pushin it to the internet for the two people that have knowledge of
my git repo to see. maybe i wanna leave a mark or perhaps make it known
that im not really mentally all there or somethin. i dont meowin know.

feb23 yay it time for dat weekly progress update. i have not gotten a lick
of anything done yet due to my procrastination and lots of school work so i
am not gonna be workin on this stuff until the school stuff(not this school
stuff)gets done and over finished 100% completion true ending. i am gonna
work on the stupid roblox game now though cause i really gotta get a move
on on that i have done nothing for that too also im not gonna work on my
website even though i kinda wanna make a funny web page right meowin now
alright thats about it seeya
