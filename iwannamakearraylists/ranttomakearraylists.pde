/* heyo, i forgot to git ps and i kinda forgot what i was gonna write so im
just gonna write about nothing for now. i gotta work after all.

ok im ready to rant about something now. i think i will do retro gaming
today. very radical i know but whatever. but first,

Last Time on Talkument Yap: I talked about the various relationships in the
Tophat Turmoil canon. They were numerous ("almost" too much so) and were
pretty low quality. To avoid a merge nightmare, I have decided to start
work on the new project instead. Genius. And now, for this Talkument Yap.

now that thats over with, i can start yapping off. so as all of you know
despite how i never told yall about it, i like the segas the best. even
though i have a nintendo 64 and a PlayStation and i never had a sega
console i truly love their consoles the best believe me. the sega genesis
is a funny one because of the addons released for it are so plentiful that
you can have a sega genesis cd 32x with 11 copies of sonic & knuckles
locked on to a game genie attached to an action replay with sonic 3 on the
top and still play sonic 3 & knuckles with a flight yoke. meanwhile the
boring snes doesnt even have any addon slots as all of the extra
capabilities were delivered through the cartridge. i mean if your console
does not even require 3 fat wall warts attached to even turn on right what
are you playing on, trash? i can play doom 32x resurrection with cd quality
audio which means if i had the 3do version and a sega cd 32x i can have
blistering fast 10fps full resolution action with the 3do soundtrack even
though i like the original ost better since it loops. also programming the
genesis is easier than the snes because it uses the 68k also used in many
japanese home pcs and the original macintoshes in conjunction with a z80
which is used in all of the texas instruments graphing calculators and is
super easy to learn. the snes has like a proprietary processor based off of
the nes s processor i think? and the sound processor is also one of those
but different? and the next console the sega saturn is like a cd 32x but
without the genesis parts and a proprietary sound processor like the other
consoles. but it has 2 gpus and 2 cpus and was incredibly hard to program
on it has to be better. i bought the nintendo 64 when i was young because
it was my favourite console at the time because look at that controller.
 _---_  im gonna make some ascii art of it on the right but just look at it
/+,*,#\ its a crazy looking controller with 3 grips like what is the third
\/|o|\/ grip for my private? at least it was the first controller made by
   V    one of the big gaming companies to have an analog stick. that was
cool but its crazy hard controlling a rareware shooter with it. but at
least it was not as bad as the PlayStations 007 shooters. those actually
just suck. ea how could you. at least i can play doom on the PlayStation.
i also had disruptor but i disk swapped it to smithereens so now it wont
boot but it can still be used as a swap disk somehow. ever since i got the
memcard pro i didnt have to worry much about swapping disks anymore cause
i can just do a unirom and boot the game from the memory card. i can also
use it as a cool cd player but i dont have any cds due to them kinda going
out of fashion 20 years ago. at least i can listen to game music with the
visualizer though. i remember when i found out about retro videogaming
because at the public library there was a game borrowing system that listed
all of the consoled they had games for, and for the playstations there were
playstation 3 and 4 games, but one day i was wondering if anything came
before playstation 3 and that brought me to the playstation 2 then the
original playstation and then all the other retro gaming consoles. i also
found out about emulation around this time and i would use the library
computers to play the snes and genesis nhls from ea sports. i still
remember playing nhl 99 n64 version on my chromebook on the website and it
lagged so much that i was able to score 24 goals in the first period due to
the extremely long reaction time i was given. after that my mother scolded
me for playing videogames and i closed it. now i have nhl 99 on my
PlayStation. I played an entire season in it and won the stanley cup with
poor sean o'donnell getting an unfunny amount of penalty minutes. it was so
many that i cant even remember the amount but i think it was over 200 at
least. and by the way i played as the kings. i think boston was the eastern
conference finalist. anyways im trying nhl 97 on the PlayStation which is
the best 5th generation console version of nhl 97. the saturn version is
just the same thing but with faux transparency and a lower framerate. the
nice thing is the saturn manual is publicly available, but sadly not the
PlayStation one so i have no idea how to play outside of the snes controls.
also i have tony hawk on both the n64 and the ps1 but sadly the n64 cart
does not feature battery backups and i do not have a memory pak so i cant
save in it. however i can just cheat anyway to get a full career so whats
the point.
ah its been so long since ive typed in this. a whole 24 hours plus. can
you believe it. and since im on my mac today the window here is just a bit
too wide so i cant judge if my text is overflowing or not. also i cant use
unifont correctly because it nyaing obliterates several of the pixels even
at just normal size. also for those of you who are calling me cringe for
being catty, you have free will to just not read my rants and yap. i have
my own free will to be catty and you cant do crud about it. for those of
you curious nyaing is nya-ing and it means like frickin or heckin etc.
example: what the nyaing heck is goin on. anyways back to the usual yap.
i feel like i might be screwed schoolwise. legit the only course that i
get straight a's in is computer studies. the closest i got to 100 in an
other course is accounting with a nyaing 95. and the third closest is like
90 or something im not even gonna bother. i wonder if ill even make it to
university with zero dollars to my name and my stupid mental stuff. grr.
i hate my mental stuff. it makes it so hard to just focus on school work.
example, this right here. almost at line 100 of yap yap yap and no stop.
is it autism, adhd, both, a third one i dont even know, like the heck is
it? i hate it because it gives me stupid end myself thoughts crippling
social anxiety depression all of this garbage that i dont need i hate it.
but i guess it is what it is. i cant change it cause i was born this way.
man im in a bad mood now. i have so much homework even though it is
barely actually anything its just the sheer volume of it. low mass, high
volume homeworks. except my brain only cares about the volume and not the
mass. i guess i should stop complaining though. i wanna write about some
thing better. i have been listening to arcus odyssey music for so long.
you know what im just gonna vomit all of my music listens here. by the
way, im a weirdo and i dont use any music streaming things. i just use
foobar2000 vlc for midi files on mac and windows media player. thats it.
i have all of the songs downloaded locally so if the network dies i still
get music. so anyways, i have been listening to arcus odyssey and sol
feace music. my favourite track from arcus is probably shrine grounds or
castomire dragon cause they sound nice. my favourites from sol feace are
enemys arsenal/cilius moon and cruise ship -glacier-/enemy cruiseship.
although i also listen to my own songs believe it or not but only the
good ones okay im lying i listen to all of them. it doesnt matter how bad
it is i just like listening to my awful music. i also listen to all the
musics from listeningmusics obviously otherwise i wouldnt be putting them
there and waste githubs storage space and also a lot of sonic and ace
attorney. i also have doom songs and shui hu feng yun zhuan stage 3 by
itself as well as some phighting songs cardboard mansion from regretty
yu yu hakusho game songs and some other ones i cant even remember cause
im away from my home pc right now. i also have too many furnace modules
with many songs in them let me know if you want me to release them.
i have made so many cat puns for kitta it aint even funny. i cant recall
if i said this before but i dont care. nyamazing kitta cat pun time nya.
so i got nyamazing, nYa huh and NyA uh for yuh huh and nuh uh, nyantastic
nyaice(nice) nyai(i) nyowch nyah(uhh) nyactually(actually) and more that
i forgot. you may now proceed to murder me lose faith in me disrespect me
whatever you wish for those horrible cat puns. and they werent even in
english they were in japanese(as in the nya not meow). pure japanese nya
puns are super easy as you just replace ya at the start of a word or na
with nya and boom nekonojiguchi da nya. nyahahaha tanoshii da rou.
i wonder when im gonna get murdered for all of this. even though its just
me being catty. also im not a furry i just like being catty. i dont hate
furries im just not one. since im on the topic of cats i might as well
leak the lore of darkitta. not kitta yet i wanna do that some other time.
but to do that i need to leak the new lore of evyle so ima do that too.
evyle(as of a few days ago)is a fan of kitta who turned evil because of
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh idk ill think of it later
anyways he wanted to make an evil kitta because kitta is good and evyle
is evil now. so he made a custom version of kittas ai that was a little
more evil and also loved fighting because evyle thought that if the evil
kitta loved fighting she would also love destroying stuff and that was
evil. so he made her and taught her the evil ways everyday but the evil
kitta ignored his teachings most of the time and instead wanted to fight
something strong. because of that evyle made some robots for evil kitta
to fight against and that is when he got the bright idea to take over
the world with those robots because that is super evil and he likes evil.
oh right i just remembered why evyle turned evil. so the Enemies from
the first games lore inspired him to be evil and that basically it. lazy.
darkitta is equipped with a bunch of hidden sharps in her palms her feet
her tail her arms practically everywhere. also her tail is finely
segmented unlike kittas triple segment tail because of the many blades in
it. darkitta is black because that is the stereotypical evil paint colour
and im not trying to be racist or anything her paint job is just black.
evyle is supposed to be a comically bad villain and as such i wrote him
to be like one. i think dave the intern from sonic boom probably inspired
his humerous incapabilities. like for example darkitta doesnt obey him
much because 1. rebellious teen spunk whatever and 2. most of the stuff
evyle demands of darkitta is evil and darkitta is just not evil because
of how evyle barely modified kittas ai for her. oh my nya i think im
gonna die writing this i made up so much useless lore and stuff and
maybe i should just become a storywriter. that would be kinda nice but i
would not be programming and i love programming. man i remember when i
was writing about music just a couple lines ago. i think my music(that i
compose)is hot dog water but maybe you dinguses who are reading this far
into this document like it? leave a comment on a commit or something if
you want more song or less yap or professionalism at all or something
like that. alas, i have not touched my code in such a long time at this
point i wonder how my grades will be affected. probably not very well,
just maybe, just a thought that it might be possible it will detriment
my grades.
so right now im tryin bluej for the ap computer science a and it it such
a ridiculous hassle to even run it that i want to swear in here. i have
tried 2 versions which both dont even start and i tried resetting the
font book and that didnt work and also deleted every font that didnt
come with osx(the backup didnt have any of my fonts)and at this point i
think it would just be easier to use processing for everything. it is
such a horrible user experience trying to get bluej to even run. i hate
it. i might as well use wine to run the windows version of bluej. ok it
finally works i had to get version 4.1.4 instead of 5.4.1 or 5.2.1 or
whatever so now im using a 6 year old version of bluej because the other
ones dont even start. how amazingly made. now i got a new repository so
that means two times the terminal work yippers for me. you know funny
thing is im trying to run a windows app with wine right now and for some
reason it doesnt work. however if i go to my osx 10.8(im using 10.13 rn)
it works like a charm. how the heck is that? i guess encruddification
has something to do with this. the only time wine works is when only the
title bar is drawn and nothing else. yahoo. the funny thing is that
no matter what system i use i am blocked from using a package manager to
install wine one way or another. 10.8 doesnt build some lib correctly
and 10.13 doesnt like homebrew and macports doesnt build another lib
correctly. and i would be a madman if i use 10.6 for wine because uh,
10.6 is so old i wonder how many viruses i will get from running a
single app in wine. i guess to the old windows server 2k8 vm i go.
okies, i just got the best sound effect ever extracted from a unity game
and its called "licensed_Greeting 2.wav". now i know all you dinguses
probably dont know what that is, but what if i told you that it is that
famous "heh-heuh" sound effect from lego juniors? now im probably not
going to upload that sound effect because it probably is copyrighted due
to the file name saying that its licensed so no heh-heuh.
i just searched up how to cure apathy because im just tired of not
wanting to do anything and the website listed several signs of apathy
and i check most of those boxes. i think i am 100% cooked. i dont even
want to cure my apathy that much.
