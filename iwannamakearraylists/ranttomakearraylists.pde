/* heyo, i forgot to git ps and i kinda forgot what i was gonna write so im
just gonna write about nothing for now. i gotta work after all.

ok im ready to rant about something now. i think i will do retro gaming
today. very radical i know but whatever. but first,

Last Time on Talkument Yap: I talked about the various relationships in the
Tophat Turmoil canon. They were numerous ("almost" too much so) and were
pretty low quality. To avoid a merge nightmare, I have decided to start
work on the new project instead. Genius. And now, for this Talkument Yap.

now that thats over with, i can start yapping off. so as all of you know
despite how i never told yall about it, i like the segas the best. even
though i have a nintendo 64 and a PlayStation and i never had a sega
console i truly love their consoles the best believe me. the sega genesis
is a funny one because of the addons released for it are so plentiful that
you can have a sega genesis cd 32x with 11 copies of sonic & knuckles
locked on to a game genie attached to an action replay with sonic 3 on the
top and still play sonic 3 & knuckles with a flight yoke. meanwhile the
boring snes doesnt even have any addon slots as all of the extra
capabilities were delivered through the cartridge. i mean if your console
does not even require 3 fat wall warts attached to even turn on right what
are you playing on, trash? i can play doom 32x resurrection with cd quality
audio which means if i had the 3do version and a sega cd 32x i can have
blistering fast 10fps full resolution action with the 3do soundtrack even
though i like the original ost better since it loops. also programming the
genesis is easier than the snes because it uses the 68k also used in many
japanese home pcs and the original macintoshes in conjunction with a z80
which is used in all of the texas instruments graphing calculators and is
super easy to learn. the snes has like a proprietary processor based off of
the nes s processor i think? and the sound processor is also one of those
but different? and the next console the sega saturn is like a cd 32x but
without the genesis parts and a proprietary sound processor like the other
consoles. but it has 2 gpus and 2 cpus and was incredibly hard to program
on it has to be better. i bought the nintendo 64 when i was young because
it was my favourite console at the time because look at that controller.
 _---_  im gonna make some ascii art of it on the right but just look at it
/+,*,#\ its a crazy looking controller with 3 grips like what is the third
\/|o|\/ grip for my private? at least it was the first controller made by
   V    one of the big gaming companies to have an analog stick. that was
cool but its crazy hard controlling a rareware shooter with it. but at
least it was not as bad as the PlayStations 007 shooters. those actually
just suck. ea how could you. at least i can play doom on the PlayStation.
i also had disruptor but i disk swapped it to smithereens so now it wont
boot but it can still be used as a swap disk somehow. ever since i got the
memcard pro i didnt have to worry much about swapping disks anymore cause
i can just do a unirom and boot the game from the memory card. i can also
use it as a cool cd player but i dont have any cds due to them kinda going
out of fashion 20 years ago. at least i can listen to game music with the
visualizer though. i remember when i found out about retro videogaming
because at the public library there was a game borrowing system that listed
all of the consoled they had games for, and for the playstations there were
playstation 3 and 4 games, but one day i was wondering if anything came
before playstation 3 and that brought me to the playstation 2 then the
original playstation and then all the other retro gaming consoles. i also
found out about emulation around this time and i would use the library
computers to play the snes and genesis nhls from ea sports. i still
remember playing nhl 99 n64 version on my chromebook on the website and it
lagged so much that i was able to score 24 goals in the first period due to
the extremely long reaction time i was given. after that my mother scolded
me for playing videogames and i closed it. now i have nhl 99 on my
PlayStation. I played an entire season in it and won the stanley cup with
poor sean o'donnell getting an unfunny amount of penalty minutes. it was so
many that i cant even remember the amount but i think it was over 200 at
least. and by the way i played as the kings. i think boston was the eastern
conference finalist. anyways im trying nhl 97 on the PlayStation which is
the best 5th generation console version of nhl 97. the saturn version is
just the same thing but with faux transparency and a lower framerate. the
nice thing is the saturn manual is publicly available, but sadly not the
PlayStation one so i have no idea how to play outside of the snes controls.
also i have tony hawk on both the n64 and the ps1 but sadly the n64 cart
does not feature battery backups and i do not have a memory pak so i cant
save in it. however i can just cheat anyway to get a full career so whats
the point.
