/* heyo, i do believe it is time to finally start work on the first tophat
turmoil. well actually if you look at the extremely convolutedly
complicated timeline of ideas you will know that this is the second game
that i thought of, but it sits as the first one in the canon. uh, i just
remembered Kitta's game which comes before this one, making this one second
in canon and third in conceivement. too complicated, my head is
proverbially spinning. i feel really tired today, not because i overloaded
on candy yesterday(i literally had 4 candies yesterday)but because trick or
treating is a lot of walking especially hard in the downpour with me wearin
you know what just read the last rant i have it all in there i think anyway
i am a little sleepy so im not gonna be able to do much work on this today
but i can most definitely work a lot more on the roblox game that i still
have no idea how to manage. just like when i first learned fisica i am
struggling to do much with roblox creator hub. im expecting that i can prob
finish something in time for christmas, so maybe i make a christmas demo.
i guess i should yap about this game though. so basically this game is very
unique as in all of the different characters stories converge into one,
unlike many other games where they stay seperate as different stories or
perspectives or whatever. maybe its not gonna be very good at the beginning
though because you can only play as one character, so its basically solo
mode. now in this processing version that dont matter for crud but for the
roblox version it will obviously hamper teamwork and playing with friends.
but then again the second games gonna come out first and that one has the
full cast available at the start of the game(excluding some secret ones) so
just play the second one? oh yeah i forgot to yap about something very
important to me right now roblox studio is not being very nice to me today.
i tried to make a remote event to teleport like any other remote event that
i made but it just wont fire no matter what. whats even stupider is that
remote events work perfectly fine in the actual level. i guess ill just
backport it and make it work. ahh, it feels nice to relax and just let it
all out again. except i still have a boatload of schoolwork to do so bleh.
okay i figured it out it was the stupid script run context. why did they
add that ARGHHHHHHH
now that ive made the thingy work im gonna make some gui stuff in it
because right now its what you would call a minimalistic ui, as in a
nonexistant one. im workin on backporting the ui from tophat tournament,
which is what i call the original team deathmatch.rbxl nowadays. 

oh man oh meow my shoulder hurts after drawin that rhythmgunner stuff.
rather, i ported the head from the genesis graphics and made a body. but
yeowf. i just remembered that i uploaded that phighting page and now only
64.6% of my code is processing. that is crazy because that means that the
amount of stuff i wrote for that page is over half the amount of code that
i have written in processing. that is wild, crazy, insan-o style. if all of
these rants get collected in a book someday i want that book to be titled
"unconventional" in all lowercase just like my writing style. i want it to
be called unconventional because thats what my coding style is. it is super
hard to read and comprehend because i never really followed major or even
common coding conventions. though i wonder, how long the book would be. it
would probably be the size of a short novel if i keep writing here though,
i gotta get back to implementing new chunks after all. also, i hate that i
keep misspelling chunks as ch!nks (censored). what makes it more ironic is
that i am one myself, although i guess not surprising because my surname is
literally wang.
