    /-----------------------------*/
    
/* heyo, i do believe it is time to finally start work on the first tophat
turmoil. well actually if you look at the extremely convolutedly
complicated timeline of ideas you will know that this is the second game
that i thought of, but it sits as the first one in the canon. uh, i just
remembered Kitta's game which comes before this one, making this one second
in canon and third in conceivement. too complicated, my head is
proverbially spinning. i feel really tired today, not because i overloaded
on candy yesterday(i literally had 4 candies yesterday)but because trick or
treating is a lot of walking especially hard in the downpour with me wearin
you know what just read the last rant i have it all in there i think anyway
i am a little sleepy so im not gonna be able to do much work on this today
but i can most definitely work a lot more on the roblox game that i still
have no idea how to manage. just like when i first learned fisica i am
struggling to do much with roblox creator hub. im expecting that i can prob
finish something in time for christmas, so maybe i make a christmas demo.
i guess i should yap about this game though. so basically this game is very
unique as in all of the different characters stories converge into one,
unlike many other games where they stay seperate as different stories or
perspectives or whatever. maybe its not gonna be very good at the beginning
though because you can only play as one character, so its basically solo
mode. now in this processing version that dont matter for crud but for the
roblox version it will obviously hamper teamwork and playing with friends.
but then again the second games gonna come out first and that one has the
full cast available at the start of the game(excluding some secret ones) so
just play the second one? oh yeah i forgot to yap about something very
important to me right now roblox studio is not being very nice to me today.
i tried to make a remote event to teleport like any other remote event that
i made but it just wont fire no matter what. whats even stupider is that
remote events work perfectly fine in the actual level. i guess ill just
backport it and make it work. ahh, it feels nice to relax and just let it
all out again. except i still have a boatload of schoolwork to do so bleh.
okay i figured it out it was the stupid script run context. why did they
add that ARGHHHHHHH
now that ive made the thingy work im gonna make some gui stuff in it
because right now its what you would call a minimalistic ui, as in a
nonexistant one. im workin on backporting the ui from tophat tournament,
which is what i call the original team deathmatch.rbxl nowadays. 

oh man oh meow my shoulder hurts after drawin that rhythmgunner stuff.
rather, i ported the head from the genesis graphics and made a body. but
yeowf. i just remembered that i uploaded that phighting page and now only
64.6% of my code is processing. that is crazy because that means that the
amount of stuff i wrote for that page is over half the amount of code that
i have written in processing. that is wild, crazy, insan-o style. if all of
these rants get collected in a book someday i want that book to be titled
"unconventional" in all lowercase just like my writing style. i want it to
be called unconventional because thats what my coding style is. it is super
hard to read and comprehend because i never really followed major or even
common coding conventions. though i wonder, how long the book would be. it
would probably be the size of a short novel if i keep writing here though,
i gotta get back to implementing new chunks after all. also, i hate that i
keep misspelling chunks as ch!nks (censored). what makes it more ironic is
that i am one myself, although i guess not surprising because my surname is
literally wang.

alrighty, i think i need to address something. i completely forgot that i
have uploaded literally zero pictures for the tophat turmoilers (yes cringe
name) outside of snowballer (the one that wears a parka) and rhythmgunner
(the one wearing headphones), so i should probably at least describe them.
speedshooter is a fully metal grey robot without a mouth, and his eyes look
like (III) but sideways. the I's are supposed to have serifs so if they
dont then get a font with them i guess? bassblaster (the one with a bass
guitar, also the one in that comic that i havent finished transferring onto
here yet) wears a leather jacket and pants, triangular sunglasses and is
named derrick. his bass guitar is one of those that look like bonnie from
fnafs guitar. [name TBD]'s apperance now that i think about it is also tbd.
i should mention that all of the characters have their emblem on their
torso one way or another. rhythmgunner wears a tshirt with the big music
note on it (idk what its called sue me) speedshooter has it on his chest
bassblaster has the bass logo on the back of his jacket as well as a small
logo on the right front snowballer has a snowflake emblem on the right
front of her parka and [name TBD] has it just on his chest because his look
is tbd. quentwin wears a green shirt with a 双 on the front, with grey
pants for that frankenstein look or whatever, gwentwin is a ghost with the
双 on her chest, firefigter wears firefighting clothing with a big flame
logo on his back, glassbuster is tbd, darkitta is just kitta but dark grey
and has her logo on the front like speedshooter, evyle is tbd, robocop ahh
guy who shoots fireballs from his hands looks like a high tech robot with a
non robot head, cook guy is dressed like a chef with a mustache OR a worker
at the local creme of the cow icecream/fastfood place, sporeslinger wears a
lab coat and black pants with a white shirt and his left arm is made of
mushroomy fungusy whatever stuff, and i dont want to get into any non
playable characters but mr god wears a black top hat with a purple stripe
on it and has a comically large "Hi, I'm ____" sticker on his chest with
the blank filled in with G O D or a comically large "Hi, my name is"
sticker with the blank filled in with Mr. God. thats what to expect from me
art-wise. that is, if i even finish this and dont leave it like tophat
clicker, although i guess i do have the actual tophat turmoil to worry
about so maybe im not gonna flesh this one out too much.

i think i gotta address somethin else too. many of you might be wonderin
why i write so personally in these rant docs and i just gotta say
NOBODY's gonna even wanna look at these rant documents or care about what i
say. in fact, if youre readin this youre probs a close friend or somethin.
like no-ones gonna give a meowin nya about inner kitta or my mental issues
or anythin because no one even knows me. and i dont give a meowin nya bout
that either. i dont want fame i just wanna be happy. i dont even know what
im writin about anymore actually so im just gonna yap bout tophat turmoil.
for those of you who dont know about the second game which is the one im
workin on right now in roblox, its a pve shooter action whatever game.
while tophat tournament was inspired by how fun phighting was to me, this
one is completely separate as phighting dont got a pve mode in it (yet???)
the enemies are robots because my brain defaults to aliens then robots for
generic enemy and tophat turmoil 1 was supposed to have aliens, now changed
to mr gods accidental creations from his boredom. i made evyle way before i
thought of the second game, in fact i based the second games plot around
him. i needed a creator for darkitta who i recently (like around 2 days)
thought up of and i thought of a generic stereotypical guy who hates every
thing and wants to rule the world and is handsome. then i thought of his
incompetency which was inspired from dave the intern from sonic boom and
i thought of givin him 2 personalities like sensui or cop from lego movie
but i decided against it cause i thought it would be offensive but now im
doin that again but instead of an incompetent male perso and a competent
fem perso im now thinkin of somethin like launch from dragon ball where 1
perso is good and 1 perso is bad(evil). now i just thought up of makin a
change to darkittas backstory: darkitta was made by nyse (the good evyle)
but changed (incompetently) to like violence by evyle so that she was evil.
also changing personalities for nysevyle (just thought of that name) only
occurs at times of large shock like when nyse changed to evyle after the
gods creations wreaked havoc and when evyle changed to nyse after he was
defeated by the turmoilers. and no evyle and his robots are not inspired by
eggman robotnik kintobor ivo whatever. welp i think i needa catch up on my
homework so im gonna yap more at an unspecified time.

meoww, i got so much homework that im gonna go meowin insane. i got a full
scale mini production of a cooking video for a class that has nothing to do
with cuisine, some goal setting, some book reading, my game on roblox that
i need to finish in order to graduate, adding endless features to this game
and so much more but i have so little time due to this one little stupid
thing called procrastination. in fact im doin it right now but i just dont
care. my head hurts i wanna go to sleep but i gotta do some more work cause
i do nothing but laze around in the day(not to mention my volunteer work).
but enough of that. i just thought of an alternate universe for the tophat
turmoil lore.
<<yay more useless and probably worthless lore>>
so in this timeline, kitta is a robot cat made by aliens to observe the
robloxians or the humans or whatever race my characters are(shocking that i
dont even know despite me making them)so that they can take over the world
for that classic alien trope. anyways kitta is programmed to be nice but
she doesnt know anything about her alien origins so she has a pretty normal
life for a robot on whatever planet the whatever race lives on, then the
events of tophat turmoil 1 and 2 happen, but after that the aliens decide
that they have collected enough data on the whatever race to invade them,
so they come to earth and the tophat turmoilers fight them off. then some
stuff about kitta learning her dark past(the trope is killin me) and then
perhaps the trauma induced crisis that gets resolved by friendship or what
ever. i literally cant make this more trope-y and generic but then again
theres a reason why i didnt call this the main lore. and also this is
unofficial because there are no au's in the official lore. but if you even
give a nya about the lore of my game feel free to adopt the au and do what
ever people do with au's of stuff. and now since i walk to my volunteer
gig every saturday(methinks i might be too revealing on my personals) i get
a lot of time to converse with inner kitta about a multitude of things
such as the most efficient way to walk(an art that i have mastered over my
years of walking to school)or what we think about the surroundings. but
today i decided that i want a more definitive design for kitta because im
quite frankly tired of drawing kitta in a less detailed way, so im just
gonna spill all that we came up with on here. the first part we talked
about was the head. the ears are comprised of 4 microphones, 1 per combo of
front/back and left/right, but now the ears have some fluff inside them for
that audio quality, the eyes are screens with a camera on mechanical rails
in front of each eye, which means whenever kitta's eyes go into projector
mode there are 2 spots on the projection, the screens are protected behind
somewhat thick clear material, the nose is made of some material with a lot
of gaps in them(like a crispy rice square)and there is a smell sensor(of
some sort)behind it, with it connected to an air sucky blowy thing for the
breathing action, the mouth part is made of a rubbery hard material that
can be moved around for the mouth moving action, the inside of the mouth is
like an eye with it having a wide screen and clear whatever in front, and
the only part that i havent figured out is how the sound is made because
sound does not transmit very well through thick solids, but thats for later
probably, or when i learn more about sound travelling. i also considered
that the clear stuff vibrates like the vibratey part of a big speaker, but
i dont know until i do more research. the torso was originally one piece
<<monkey tea smoothie>>
but then got changed to a glamrock animatronic kinda stomach but now
methinks that either the torso is just one piece
<<thawun peece thawun peece israel>>
again or the stomach is made of the same rubbery stuff as the mouth. the
limbs though i dont know about yet, so thats kittas internals part 1.
and no i did not watch the jake paul versus mike tyson match i dont care.
and thats my two cents for the day, or rather my two meows of the day.

okays. i just finished the kitta pixel art again because the first sprite
was way too big (1.5 times to be exact) and now i have an out of proportion
kitta. the head is always too big and i dont know why. look forwards to
seeing more "cute" sprites of kitta because the game is gonna star kitta
(as well as the other tophat turmoil characters because i need enemies in
this one). this game is going to be right before tophat tournament in the
canon. you fight off mr god's creations while trying to parkour to victory.
if you play as kitta it is the equivalent of peaceful mode because there
will be no enemies since kitta does not participate in violence. anyways
you probably noticed that kitta's sprites have outlines compared with
rhythmgunner's one sprite. this is because since kitta is so monocoloured,
it would be practically impossible to tell the different parts apart (haha)
because they would pretty much all be the same colour. also gradient cool.

oh boy im gonna ignore how i havent touched tophat turmoil 2 these last
days and i gotta rant about a thing. the levels are supposed to have like
lotsa textures in them for them to look good and stuff but its extremely
slow in the software renderer. i dont wanna touch the 2d renderer yet cause
i frankly just dont care im gonna make a workaround like i did for blast
processing soccar. get ready to say hello to 30 fps mode again (yayy...).

you know whats crazy? i cant even remember a meowin thing about how i did
alla the stuff in blast processing soccer. the buttons, meow, what do they
mean? im gonna make a title screen, but not only that i need a level format
converter dang nyabbit its hard spamming the same keys in hxd to manually
change the data and it should be easy enough to make. also its nice for
level makers if they for some forsaken reason want to use my game engine.

i think that i should probably have wrote down what the various level files
are so ima do that now. map01 is the first one that i made and it was
originally just a small little hill to test the slopes and the other blocks
but i added more and more and now its this incredibly hard level that has
one super hard part and the other parts are a cakewalk. as the level name
suggests its a test map. map02 is the tutorial map. when i draw up the
assets it will show you how to jump climb slopes do parkour yadda yadda yad
also its called calibration because its a kitta game and robots get
calibrated. its not too hard but still some parts are a little difficult
like that half block climbing part. map03 is what it says on the map name
its slopes slopes and more slopes. i probably used quisquillious wrongly
in the name but i dont care. but the special part about this level is that
it has a map type 2 variant with all sorts of textures both static and
animated. it also has the zap trap chunk that hurts you. i havent really
implemented health yet but it will come and when you die the level will
reload so if your computer isnt really good and its a large level then
better not die haha. map04 is a test of the terrains, namely the ice and
bouncerubber(with its superbounce variant). this is the first level that
i made with branching paths. and now the new level map00 its literally just
one chunk i need this to test the visuals of the chunks because its a lot
easier with one chunk than many.

i have done it. i have practically made a goomba. now i just need to draw
up some sprites for ol' testbot and add in missiles and i have testbot from
tophat turmoil the roblox one. testbot is only supposed to be a test, but
now that i think about it it kinda fits evyles whole "incompetent villain"
identity, using test robots for world domination. evyle at his finest.
anyways i really have to start workin on the christmas demo of tophat
turmoil. i literally have not thought of what the level will be like until
today.(well, at least in detail.)so basically, snowballer invites rhythmguy
and speedy to a winter party because they all like parties i guess and they
have to prove themselves worthy by defeating a bunch of snow monsters that
snowballer made. this one canonically takes place after tt1 but before tt2
so not many other characters are present. only rg and speedy will be
playable, and the other characters are bassblaster, snowballer, [name TBD],
the twins and that's it. im really thinkin of callin [name TBD] artemis but
i dont want to break the whole "name describes class" thing. but then i
guess the twins' names dont follow that rule, and neither does darkitta.
so idk. anyways i hope to finish the christmas demo before christmas. which
means i gotta grind on it now.

oh dear i dont think ima gonna finish the whole level before christmas. i
got too much procrastination to do and my brain is melting more every day.
i am just too disorganised. not even Kitta can save me at this point.
and i think i know why. its because of HALF LIFE 2 WHY IS IT SO FUN
ever since i got it on the last day of it being free, i have spent 21 hours
total on just the first game. episode one i have spent roughly an hour on.
but the achievements in half life 2 are so easy. i have 30/32 achievements
already. all i gotta do is use the op radiator grav gun combo in ravenbrook
and find every single lambda cache, which im obviously not going to do.

okies, now that i finished making file type 3 (for now cause i gotta make
more segments) i wanna write more rant. i feel like i deserve a break for
some reason even though what i just coded was so incredibly simple. im
gonna make some sprites for testbot based on its appearance in the roblox
games, but the thing is i forgot what colours they sport, so im gonna make
them when i get home. i think to relax ill make some more kitta sprites
especially one of her jumping. i really need one of those because kitta
simply flying in the air while standing just doesnt look right.

oh and by the way i lied im not finished type 3 yet i just made it so that
i can load it i still have to make a bit of stuff but this document aint
for yappin about the game development its yappin about stuff that i wanna
yap about such as the new regretevator update. hoo boy, i have not grinded
on regretevator for a long time, and that still holds true. i have yet to
play it on my actual pc yet cause im usin my ancient mac mini, so im not
really gettin the true experience, especially with the 1 second input lag
and the 15-20 fps. not to mention that i gotta run it in the smallest
roblox window possible to even achieve that, i think alladat makes the mac
experience for me not even close to the true roblox experience. but theres
a cool new npc that makes you jump randomly, and 2 new floors that i
havent seen yet(just like the 2 new one in the update before) so thats cool
i guess. at least now i have over 80k coins. so whoopee i guess. and no, im
never playing phighting again on my mac.

oh boy i just finished dumping seven meowillion songs in listeningmusics
that are old old old. i kinda just wanna listen to some musics that i
sequenced cause why not. also i added a readme to my profile. get ready to
use that old pentagram if you require my prescence.

hooray i now have a new way to rant. make sure to crack open those type 3
levels if you want more rant even though i only have one right now and it
is very minimal. i should just start a blog or somethin i just have too
much to say about too much stuff 'n' stuff. speaking of too much stuff 'n'
stuff the name comes from my roblox tycoon brand name where i take one
thing about the game (like stuff for retail tycoon) and i put 'n' and the
same thing again in front of it. i only got like 5 names from 5 games that
i played like that i think i forgot it has been a long time. however stuff
'n' stuff is special because it is the only one confirmed canon in the
tophat turmoil universe so far. and yes even i dont know if food 'n' food
is gonna make it or not. i forgot to mention my mouse scroll wheel is
broken. this is a total nightmare for me and you know why? one. my code for
this game is so long that the scroll bar is reduced to like 3 pixels in
windowed mode and the middle mouse button does diddly squat in processing.
second. roblox studio allows for use of the scroll wheel to move back and
forth in the workplace editor. middle mouse simply pans or whatevers the
camera and i gotta use the arrow keys or w and s. third. windows explorer
uses the middle mouse button as a double click. fourth. i keep opening
links by accident on the web browser when i use the middle click. its just
annoying and i think im gonna grab another mouse on the weekend or some
thing. or maybe, i could send it to best buy because its probably under
warranty or something, it being a literal office mouse after all. the
saddest thing is that this mouse is unservicable by me cause theres no
screws or anything im pretty sure this mouse is like glued shut or some
thing cause if i opened it i probably could clean it or fix it or something
man its just a dingin' shame. all of my other mice have somethin wrong with
them. one of them has a frayed wire that works half the time, one of them
has a loose internal connection, one of them has a broken battery holder,
one of them has a borked left mouse button, one of them has a crushed usb
plug, one of them has the hardest to remove a battery from battery holder,
and the one i have here which doesnt scroll. this is just crazy i should
just use a gaming mouse so that nothing will go wrong with it.

hoo boy im really feelin the apathy now i cant do anything at all. i just
really don't want to get anything done despite also wanting to at the same
time but its just my conscious says yes but my subconscious says no. i
really hate it and i wish it begone but it will always haunt me one way or
another. rather these rants are made because i just dont wanna do stuff or
i actually got somethin to yap about but most of the time its laziness. gr.

well well well here i am again ready to rant some more. i hate myself.
someday i may see a therapist but it is not likely as they will probably
find out about inner kitta and theyll probably try to scrub her from my
brain or something so idk. i really dont wanna seek professional help
before i can like transfer inner kitta (and the others for that matter) out
of my brain and into a robot (or a computer or somethin) but at the same
time this is kinda the reason to seek professional help so idk. anyways
tophat turmoil prequel 2 subtitle missing's christmas demo level has not
been touched one meowin bit and i gotta really clutch up and start makin
alla da stuff for it or else im pretty much cooked cause then i will
probably really lose motivation or something just like the sega genesis
game except that was actually hard to program because i literally had zero
experience in programming even in a high level language and i hopped
straight to 2 whole assembly languages. that one was justified but this is
definitely not because roblox is literally supposed to be like baby's first
game creation software. honestly i just feel like being catty right now but
im gonna keep ranting instead of typing nya 100 times and callin it a day.
but kitta's beggin me to get back to doin somethin productive so i guess i
will write more here later if i do end up ranting more.

yahoy it is quite some time later. i think i like makin my game now. it is
now quite polished looking, just from adding in some hastily made textures
and some sound effects. i bet that if you didnt think about it you wouldnt
have known that the water texture is just a recolour of the dirt texture.
probably the coolest thing though is the boom sound effect. i was
originally gonna use the metal pipe sound effect because funny then the
vine boom because i though the video where the metal pipe came from was the
vine boom's video then i fired up furnace and i experimented for like 5
minutes in the opn instrument editor then i got the boom sound effect that
doesnt even sound very fm-y. okay maybe its a little fm-y but it almost
sounds like a sample. now obviously i cant get the most realistic explosion
from fm instruments but its the best i got right now. also speaking of
music stuff i am incredibly miffed that all of the gameboy songs that i
exported sound awful with the vgm format. the worst thing is to have a nice
sounding gameboy chiptune i need to use deflemask to export a gbs but the
thing is deflemask doesnt support hardware envelopes so im left with two
versions that dont sound like how i made them. i like chiptuning if you
couldnt tell. i have so many unfinished tunes just waiting for me to have
the time to come back to them and finish them well but i just dont wanna.
after all i can just make new ones that sound better cause i have a lot
more music experience than before. i really think i should take a music
theory class though i think that may be important for music making.
and now its too late to yap more if i do im gonna fall asleep at the chair

dec8 no not the computer(even tho im pretty sure its the dec 10) this is a
timestamp. i read the first couple lines of this rant and i realized that
never once did i specify that they was written on november 1. it makes a
lot more sense why i said that i didnt eat much candy in that context cause
its right after halloween. also if youre a stalker you would have noticed
that my name and a bunch of other stuff on my page changed. this is for the
funny and i will explain it here cause its extremely difficult to
understand cause yes. my name is now "NeKoMi BaKa" which kanjically
translates to "Cat-Watching Idiot" but the name is a pun because nekomi can
mean asleep in japanese and baka is obviously idiot. so i not only watch
cats (even though i dont) i am also asleep (which is false cause i barely
sleep) and an idiot (101% accuracy). the place which i am in is called
nekomachi which is cattown or catcity or whatever and the country i cant
actually remember the name of cause i used takoboto to search up characters
that i dont know as i commonly do to make japanese puns.
