/* heyo, i do believe it is time to finally start work on the first tophat
turmoil. well actually if you look at the extremely convolutedly
complicated timeline of ideas you will know that this is the second game
that i thought of, but it sits as the first one in the canon. uh, i just
remembered Kitta's game which comes before this one, making this one second
in canon and third in conceivement. too complicated, my head is
proverbially spinning. i feel really tired today, not because i overloaded
on candy yesterday(i literally had 4 candies yesterday)but because trick or
treating is a lot of walking especially hard in the downpour with me wearin
you know what just read the last rant i have it all in there i think anyway
i am a little sleepy so im not gonna be able to do much work on this today
but i can most definitely work a lot more on the roblox game that i still
have no idea how to manage. just like when i first learned fisica i am
struggling to do much with roblox creator hub. im expecting that i can prob
finish something in time for christmas, so maybe i make a christmas demo.
i guess i should yap about this game though. so basically this game is very
unique as in all of the different characters stories converge into one,
unlike many other games where they stay seperate as different stories or
perspectives or whatever. maybe its not gonna be very good at the beginning
though because you can only play as one character, so its basically solo
mode. now in this processing version that dont matter for crud but for the
roblox version it will obviously hamper teamwork and playing with friends.
but then again the second games gonna come out first and that one has the
full cast available at the start of the game(excluding some secret ones) so
just play the second one? oh yeah i forgot to yap about something very
important to me right now roblox studio is not being very nice to me today.
i tried to make a remote event to teleport like any other remote event that
i made but it just wont fire no matter what. whats even stupider is that
remote events work perfectly fine in the actual level. i guess ill just
backport it and make it work. ahh, it feels nice to relax and just let it
all out again. except i still have a boatload of schoolwork to do so bleh.
okay i figured it out it was the stupid script run context. why did they
add that ARGHHHHHHH
now that ive made the thingy work im gonna make some gui stuff in it
because right now its what you would call a minimalistic ui, as in a
nonexistant one. im workin on backporting the ui from tophat tournament,
which is what i call the original team deathmatch.rbxl nowadays. 

oh man oh meow my shoulder hurts after drawin that rhythmgunner stuff.
rather, i ported the head from the genesis graphics and made a body. but
yeowf. i just remembered that i uploaded that phighting page and now only
64.6% of my code is processing. that is crazy because that means that the
amount of stuff i wrote for that page is over half the amount of code that
i have written in processing. that is wild, crazy, insan-o style. if all of
these rants get collected in a book someday i want that book to be titled
"unconventional" in all lowercase just like my writing style. i want it to
be called unconventional because thats what my coding style is. it is super
hard to read and comprehend because i never really followed major or even
common coding conventions. though i wonder, how long the book would be. it
would probably be the size of a short novel if i keep writing here though,
i gotta get back to implementing new chunks after all. also, i hate that i
keep misspelling chunks as ch!nks (censored). what makes it more ironic is
that i am one myself, although i guess not surprising because my surname is
literally wang.

alrighty, i think i need to address something. i completely forgot that i
have uploaded literally zero pictures for the tophat turmoilers (yes cringe
name) outside of snowballer (the one that wears a parka) and rhythmgunner
(the one wearing headphones), so i should probably at least describe them.
speedshooter is a fully metal grey robot without a mouth, and his eyes look
like (III) but sideways. the I's are supposed to have serifs so if they
dont then get a font with them i guess? bassblaster (the one with a bass
guitar, also the one in that comic that i havent finished transferring onto
here yet) wears a leather jacket and pants, triangular sunglasses and is
named derrick. his bass guitar is one of those that look like bonnie from
fnafs guitar. [name TBD]'s apperance now that i think about it is also tbd.
i should mention that all of the characters have their emblem on their
torso one way or another. rhythmgunner wears a tshirt with the big music
note on it (idk what its called sue me) speedshooter has it on his chest
bassblaster has the bass logo on the back of his jacket as well as a small
logo on the right front snowballer has a snowflake emblem on the right
front of her parka and [name TBD] has it just on his chest because his look
is tbd. quentwin wears a green shirt with a 双 on the front, with grey
pants for that frankenstein look or whatever, gwentwin is a ghost with the
双 on her chest, firefigter wears firefighting clothing with a big flame
logo on his back, glassbuster is tbd, darkitta is just kitta but dark grey
and has her logo on the front like speedshooter, evyle is tbd, robocop ahh
guy who shoots fireballs from his hands looks like a high tech robot with a
non robot head, cook guy is dressed like a chef with a mustache OR a worker
at the local creme of the cow icecream/fastfood place, sporeslinger wears a
lab coat and black pants with a white shirt and his left arm is made of
mushroomy fungusy whatever stuff, and i dont want to get into any non
playable characters but mr god wears a black top hat with a purple stripe
on it and has a comically large "Hi, I'm ____" sticker on his chest with
the blank filled in with G O D or a comically large "Hi, my name is"
sticker with the blank filled in with Mr. God. thats what to expect from me
art-wise. that is, if i even finish this and dont leave it like tophat
clicker, although i guess i do have the actual tophat turmoil to worry
about so maybe im not gonna flesh this one out too much.

i think i gotta address somethin else too. many of you might be wonderin
why i write so personally in these rant docs and i just gotta say
NOBODY's gonna even wanna look at these rant documents or care about what i
say. in fact, if youre readin this youre probs a close friend or somethin.
like no-ones gonna give a meowin nya about inner kitta or my mental issues
or anythin because no one even knows me. and i dont give a meowin nya bout
that either. i dont want fame i just wanna be happy. i dont even know what
im writin about anymore actually so im just gonna yap bout tophat turmoil.
for those of you who dont know about the second game which is the one im
workin on right now in roblox, its a pve shooter action whatever game.
while tophat tournament was inspired by how fun phighting was to me, this
one is completely separate as phighting dont got a pve mode in it (yet???)
the enemies are robots because my brain defaults to aliens then robots for
generic enemy and tophat turmoil 1 was supposed to have aliens, now changed
to mr gods accidental creations from his boredom. i made evyle way before i
thought of the second game, in fact i based the second games plot around
him. i needed a creator for darkitta who i recently (like around 2 days)
thought up of and i thought of a generic stereotypical guy who hates every
thing and wants to rule the world and is handsome. then i thought of his
incompetency which was inspired from dave the intern from sonic boom and
i thought of givin him 2 personalities like sensui or cop from lego movie
but i decided against it cause i thought it would be offensive but now im
doin that again but instead of an incompetent male perso and a competent
fem perso im now thinkin of somethin like launch from dragon ball where 1
perso is good and 1 perso is bad(evil). now i just thought up of makin a
change to darkittas backstory: darkitta was made by nyse (the good evyle)
but changed (incompetently) to like violence by evyle so that she was evil.
also changing personalities for nysevyle (just thought of that name) only
occurs at times of large shock like when nyse changed to evyle after the
gods creations wreaked havoc and when evyle changed to nyse after he was
defeated by the turmoilers. and no evyle and his robots are not inspired by
eggman robotnik kintobor ivo whatever. welp i think i needa catch up on my
homework so im gonna yap more at an unspecified time.

meoww, i got so much homework that im gonna go meowin insane. i got a full
scale mini production of a cooking video for a class that has nothing to do
with cuisine, some goal setting, some book reading, my game on roblox that
i need to finish in order to graduate, adding endless features to this game
and so much more but i have so little time due to this one little stupid
thing called procrastination. in fact im doin it right now but i just dont
care. my head hurts i wanna go to sleep but i gotta do some more work cause
i do nothing but laze around in the day(not to mention my volunteer work).
but enough of that. i just thought of an alternate universe for the tophat
turmoil lore.
<<yay more useless and probably worthless lore>>
so in this timeline, kitta is a robot cat made by aliens to observe the
robloxians or the humans or whatever race my characters are(shocking that i
dont even know despite me making them)so that they can take over the world
for that classic alien trope. anyways kitta is programmed to be nice but
she doesnt know anything about her alien origins so she has a pretty normal
life for a robot on whatever planet the whatever race lives on, then the
events of tophat turmoil 1 and 2 happen, but after that the aliens decide
that they have collected enough data on the whatever race to invade them,
so they come to earth and the tophat turmoilers fight them off. then some
stuff about kitta learning her dark past(the trope is killin me) and then
perhaps the trauma induced crisis that gets resolved by friendship or what
ever. i literally cant make this more trope-y and generic but then again
theres a reason why i didnt call this the main lore. and also this is
unofficial because there are no au's in the official lore. but if you even
give a nya about the lore of my game feel free to adopt the au and do what
ever people do with au's of stuff. and now since i walk to my volunteer
gig every saturday(methinks i might be too revealing on my personals) i get
a lot of time to converse with inner kitta about a multitude of things
such as the most efficient way to walk(an art that i have mastered over my
years of walking to school)or what we think about the surroundings. but
today i decided that i want a more definitive design for kitta because im
quite frankly tired of drawing kitta in a less detailed way, so im just
gonna spill all that we came up with on here. the first part we talked
about was the head. the ears are comprised of 4 microphones, 1 per combo of
front/back and left/right, but now the ears have some fluff inside them for
that audio quality, the eyes are screens with a camera on mechanical rails
in front of each eye, which means whenever kitta's eyes go into projector
mode there are 2 spots on the projection, the screens are protected behind
somewhat thick clear material, the nose is made of some material with a lot
of gaps in them(like a crispy rice square)and there is a smell sensor(of
some sort)behind it, with it connected to an air sucky blowy thing for the
breathing action, the mouth part is made of a rubbery hard material that
can be moved around for the mouth moving action, the inside of the mouth is
like an eye with it having a wide screen and clear whatever in front, and
the only part that i havent figured out is how the sound is made because
sound does not transmit very well through thick solids, but thats for later
probably, or when i learn more about sound travelling. i also considered
that the clear stuff vibrates like the vibratey part of a big speaker, but
i dont know until i do more research. the torso was originally one piece
<<monkey tea smoothie>>
but then got changed to a glamrock animatronic kinda stomach but now
methinks that either the torso is just one piece
<<thawun peece thawun peece israel>>
again or the stomach is made of the same rubbery stuff as the mouth. the
limbs though i dont know about yet, so thats kittas internals part 1.
and no i did not watch the jake paul versus mike tyson match i dont care.
and thats my two cents for the day, or rather my two meows of the day.

okays. i just finished the kitta pixel art again because the first sprite
was way too big (1.5 times to be exact) and now i have an out of proportion
kitta. the head is always too big and i dont know why. look forwards to
seeing more "cute" sprites of kitta because the game is gonna star kitta
(as well as the other tophat turmoil characters because i need enemies in
this one). this game is going to be right before tophat tournament in the
canon. you fight off mr god's creations while trying to parkour to victory.
if you play as kitta it is the equivalent of peaceful mode because there
will be no enemies since kitta does not participate in violence. anyways
you probably noticed that kitta's sprites have outlines compared with
rhythmgunner's one sprite. this is because since kitta is so monocoloured,
it would be practically impossible to tell the different parts apart (haha)
because they would pretty much all be the same colour. also gradient cool.

oh boy im gonna ignore how i havent touched tophat turmoil 2 these last
days and i gotta rant about a thing. the levels are supposed to have like
lotsa textures in them for them to look good and stuff but its extremely
slow in the software renderer. i dont wanna touch the 2d renderer yet cause
i frankly just dont care im gonna make a workaround like i did for blast
processing soccar. get ready to say hello to 30 fps mode again (yayy...).

you know whats crazy? i cant even remember a meowin thing about how i did
alla the stuff in blast processing soccer. the buttons, meow, what do they
mean? im gonna make a title screen, but not only that i need a level format
converter dang nyabbit its hard spamming the same keys in hxd to manually
change the data and it should be easy enough to make. also its nice for
level makers if they for some forsaken reason want to use my game engine.
