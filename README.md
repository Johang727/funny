## What is it?
This repository contains all of the [stuff](#the-stuff) that I make for my programming course.  
It also has [music](#the-music), some made by me and some made by other people.
## When is it?
This repository was created on the 5th of September of 2024 AD. Creation dates for individual applications can be found in their source file (prefixed by `iwanna`) in the header block.
## Why is it?
This repository serves two purposes.
1. I can have the world see and run my crudtastic code creations.
2. I can do all sorts of silly things on GitHub that probably shouldn't be done.
## Where is it?
I'm too lazy to search up where GitHub's servers are or which server(s) is/are hosting my files.
## Who is it?
Lookit my profile you dingus.
## How is it?
Using some black magic with the much less documented white magic to form græy magic, I formed a legal græy area which I pulled an unactivated copy of Windows 11 and a school laptop out of. I then exploited the græy magic's internet connectivity ability to sign up for a GitHub account and make this repository.
