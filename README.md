FINE ill add a readme

hello. this is some stuff that im doing for school.  
at school i need to do stuff and this is that stuff.  
if i didnt have to do this stuff,  
this stuff would not exist.  
by me creating this stuff,  
im making this stuff exist.  
if i wasnt taught about how to code,  
i would not have coded this code.  
but since i was taught programming,  
i possess that knowledge.  
every day i get get up early,  
and march my way to school.  
had i not got up one day,  
i wouldve missed a class.  
alas, i have ran this text  
longer than i should,  
if i dont get back to my code,  
i would not be programming.  

Now that the non stupidity-appreciators have left, I think that I will actually make a good readme. This (as mentioned before) is the repository for all of the applications that I have made for class. They are probably not very well coded (which is why I'm in a class) so if you look at the sources beware. Now, the list of projects with their descriptions. If you want the funny descriptions, check the sources.  
1. iwannahouse: A simple house with a cool backdrop.  
2. iwannadrawkitta: A barebones graphics showcase.  
3. iwannamakepatterns: A barebones graphics showcase.  
4. iwannabeaballer: A simple little basketball game.  
5. iwannaseekeys: A key character/code/ascii viewer.  
6. iwannamakeamover: An interactable mover showcase.  
7. iwannamakebuttons: A small button class showcase.  
8. iwannausegifs: An unfinished prototype gif class.  
9. iwannamakearraylists: A try at using arraylists.  
10. iwannahavephysics: A simple physics sandbox.  
11. iwannamakesoccar: A version of Rocket League.  
12. iwannatestthelibraries: A try at using tabs.

Excuse me for some poor descriptions, I like to keep the consistency of the line lengths. I compile releases for some of the better apps. I try to get every version that I can, including separate versions for different architectures, OS's and with/without a bundled Java runtime for size. Feel free to request a certain release if it is not available and I might make all of them.
