FINE ill add a readme

hello. this is some stuff that im doing for school.  
at school i need to do stuff and this is that stuff.  
if i didnt have to do this stuff,  
this stuff would not exist.  
by me creating this stuff,  
im making this stuff exist.  
if i wasnt taught about how to code,  
i would not have coded this code.  
but since i was taught programming,  
i possess that knowledge.  
every day i get get up early,  
and march my way to school.  
had i not got up one day,  
i wouldve missed a class.  
alas, i have ran this text  
longer than i should,  
if i dont get back to my code,  
i would not be programming.
