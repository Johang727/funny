  heyo, I'm not even finished my last project yet.
  Actually I haven't even started this one.
  I just want to note down that I want to make a
  golf game for the twoplayergames thingy.
  It's gonna be like the EA golf games on the GB.
  
  Okay, so maybe I will do a twoplayergames game.
  I actually don't think the golf game will be
  fitting of the criteria.
