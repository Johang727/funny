  heyo, I'm not even finished my last project yet.
  Actually I haven't even started this one.
  I just want to note down that I want to make a
  golf game for the twoplayergames thingy.
  It's gonna be like the EA golf games on the GB.
  
  Ok, even though this isnt the file with the yap,
  I'm going to record my thoughts on the Phestival,
  just so I can learn to merge changes and so I
  don't forget about it like the idiot I am.
  The Phestival ended at 9:23 PM yesterday,
  while I was marvelling at how a skateboard and
  a shuriken managed to get on the lost temple tunnel.
  Needless to say, team pirate won, maybe since
  it was the most popular team (probably).
  We won 6 of the 8 categories, with the first half
  being fully won by the pirates, which meant
  the scoring for the first half was 40-0, with
  10 points per category. The second half,
  it became 80-40 because it was 20 points per.
  The reward skin was Coil 2.0, which I IMMEDIATELY
  called "Coilgraft" because it looked like Coil
  was a Biograft, kinda.
  Anyways, I only found 2 other skins in the lobby.
  The first one was Steampunk(?) Scythe, who now
  occupies the murder apartment room. Obviously,
  I did not buy since I don't play Scythe.
  The other one was on the flingy cheese side
  of the Rat Zone. Now, I thought the skin was like
  Piratekit 2.0 or something, because in the game
  icon and banner, it looked like it was Medkit.
  However the skin turned out to be Captain Rocket,
  which I bought anyway because cool rocket skin.
  Now I am only 32k bux poorer since the phestival
  awarded a whopping 3k bux to me for winning.
  Or maybe I read the price wrong and it was 32k bux.
  Anyways I gotta go to school cause school.
  I'm gonna learn how to merge no matter what.
