/* Heyo. I guess it's time to yap more.
  Last time on Talkument Yap,
  I promised to write more about
  making chiptunes and the (in-game)
  origins of Rhythmgunner.

I'll start with chiptunes I guess.
Ever since I wanted to make a SNES
game from scratch with 0 experience,
I composed music. The first pieces
that I made were for the SNES in a
software called SNES GSS, or
SNES Game Sound Solution/System.
I made a couple tunes, but none
of them were really good at all.
The game was called Sonic M,
(thus the "Sonic M Soundtrack" in
some of my chiptunes)
it was a Sonic game that I wanted
to make ever since 2019-ish.
I have moved past that now, but
the important part is that
Sonic M was ultimately the thing
that got me to start chiptuning.
I then found more about chiptunes
and vgms, and foobar2000.
The earliest trace of vgms stuff
on my pc is from
Wednesday, May 18, 2022, 05:08:55 PM
according to the properties of
foobar2000's folder.
I started making chiptunes with
VGM Music Maker, which sure is a
music making tool all right.
It was hard to use, so I moved
on to DefleMask. I thought it was
lackluster at first, because I was
so used to using samples like the
orchestra hit that I had trouble
porting my songs to the Genesis,
which used FM Synthesis.
But then, I discovered the power
of wavetables. I made so many
songs on the PC Engine, it's
crazy. I used it to create songs
for 2 Scratch games, 1 of which
doesn't even work right.
I should probably put the vgm
of the most notable one in my
listeningmusics folder someday.
I also made chiptunes for all
of the other systems in DefleMask
(with the exception of the OPM)
which are also cool. But then,
one day, specifically before
my birthday 2023, I made a
"Birthday Chill Tune" (as I
called it back then) that in
hindsight sucks a lot.
However, I wanted to use more
systems than DefleMask allowed,
so on my birthday, I stumbled
across furnace. furnace is like
DefleMask, execpt for 2 things:
it's completely free, and
there are SO many systems.
After I posted a lackluster
music video of the chill tune,
I downloaded furnace (0.6pre5)
and that leads into my
chiptuning at the present.
I also switched from Windows
to Ubuntu and back, so I have
some duplicate songs from
when I was trying to backport
my songs from Ubuntu,
because Windows doesn't allow
me to mount its partition.
I love the subsong feature in
furnace, because instead of
having like 7000 different
files in DefleMask, each
having its own instruments,
you can have 1 big file in
furnace with shared
instruments. furnace's file
compression is also a lot
better than DefleMask's
(if it even exists)
and has a bazillion
settings, like different
cores for chip emulation.
Right now, I have 2 big files,
one for the Genesis, and one
for the Master System with the
FM chip. I also have some
smaller files that are for
specific songs, like the Rave
Dancetune from Cool Spot,
or a bunch of Ace Attorney songs,
both on the Game Boy.
I have currently 66 subsongs
in the Master System file, and
105 subsongs in the Genesis file.
Using extremely inaccurate
estimates, I think 50% of the
songs are covers, and around
5% are finished. 5% of them
are Phighting songs.
Making songs can be very easy
or very hard. For example, when
I was making Kitta's theme on
the Genesis, it was very easy,
reason being that I basically
completed it already on the
Master System. The Master
System version was very hard
because I didn't want the
cliché 2nd half of the song,
so I tried to make something
new. It sounds terrible.
It also incorperates an older
Kitta song into it, as support.
The Genesis version also has
lyrics, by the way. I'm not
gonna post them unless I'm
met with popular demand
(on GitHub, no less), since all
of the lyrics that I make are
automatically cringe, so that
probably means that I'm not
gonna post them ever.
Or maybe I will do that in the
next Talkument Yap. IDK.
That about sums up my
chiptuning journey. Now, onto
 RHYTHMGUNNER'S BACKSTORY
(taken from the paper doc)
--commentary in lua comments

Rhythmgunner always thought
of commiting an act of
violence every time he heard a
song that he disliked, which
was why he was called a
violent boy in dance class.
--This is the obligational
--funny in the first part
--of a short story. The
--dance class thing was
--because I didn't like songs
--from ANY dance class that
--I had at school.
R.G. was born with a 6th
musical sense. When his parents
bought him a xylophonw, he
cried because there weren't
enough keys to play his
beautiful songs on.
--This part is a little over
--exaggerated.
He had many friends due to his
musical talent, especially his
talent of learning any
instrument just by playing it
for a little while.
--SUPER exaggerated.
He was so good at music that
the teachers had to ban him
from entering the music room
outside of music class because
he would play solo better than
the whole class, usually ending
up in a musical competition
that he would always win.
--Beating elementary school
--children at playing music is
--easier than you think.
--(I was horrible on the
--recorder and clarinet)
He graduated with many musical
majors. Rhythmgunner had a
bright future ahead of him,
except for one small problem.
He was broke as ####.
--Kinda unbelievable because
--of his musical talents and
--majors, but whatever.
He started selling CDs
--with what money?
with hand-drawn labels on them.
--Ah yes, true grass roots ahh.
They didn't sell very well,
because everybody used
streaming services.
--I have nothing against music
--streaming, just a detail to
--support the plot.
However, one day, a man in a
black leather jacket came up
to him and bought a CD. The
next day, the same guy walked
past him and flew him a sheet
of paper.
--"Flew him" means threw at
--him subtly like a paper
--airplane, and the sheet
--was more like a slip.
It said, "Bonue Bridge,
6:30 PM". So at 6:30 PM,
Rhythmgunner went below the
Bonue Bridge, and saw him.
--PSA, don't trust random
--slips of paper that
--random strangers give you.
--The next part is a little
--comic, which I obviously
--can't show here, so instead
--the transcript will be
--written. It is in Japanese,
--but the original English
--translation will be shown
--below the phrases.
--I'm not gonna retranslate
--it for now.
--Also, my Japanese sucks.
--Sorry, native speakers.

Bassblaster:
あなたは
リーゼムガンナ
ですか？
Are you Rhythmgunner?
-------------------------
Rhythmgunner:
はい、でも
なぜ俺た
ちは日本
語を話
しますか。
Yes, but why are we
speaking in Japanese?
-------------------------
Bassblaster:
俺も知って
ないよ。
I don't know either.
-------------------------
Bassblaster:
さあ、俺
を知るか。
Anyways, do you know me?
-------------------------
Rhythmgunner:
ア～ッム、
すみません。
あなたを知る
ない。
Umm, sorry,
I don't know you.
-------------------------
Bassblaster:
えっ？知る
ないか？
本当かー？
Huh? You don't know?
No joke?
-------------------------
Bassblaster:
俺の顔を
見て！！！今
知るか?
Look at my face!
Do you know me?
-------------------------
Rhythmgunner:
す、すみません…
S-Sorry...
Bassblaster:
アーッ？
HUH?
(Note: This original
Japanese text was
outline-bolded.)

I'm just gonna continue
writing some random stuff
down here. Don't worry,
I'm gonna continue the
transcribing of the comic,
it's just that I'm in
class right now and I
want to write about more
class related stuff.
(says the guy who's
yapping instead of coding)
I have used the same
computer here for 3 years
in a row. I gotta backup
this thing to OneDrive or
something someday.
I should be working on
baller game actually.
And also, this file is now
over 300 lines long.
Granted, every line is
like 5 words long, but
that is still a whopping
1500 words. A whole essay.
I guess next time I will
talk about Speedshooter's
origins and how I got
exposed to retro computing.
Yappin' Yoplar out.
P.S. Yoplar is a silly
name that I thought up
for my Nintendo account.
It doesn't mean anything.
I just made it up on the
spot.
