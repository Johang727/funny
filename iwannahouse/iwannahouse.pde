//YIKES! I FORGOT ABOUT THE PHIGHTING PHESTIVAL THAT JUST STARTED YESTERDAY!
//oh yeah, and this section of yap too i guess...
//oh man, course changes are crazy. 4 hours aint worth it just to get no math.
//at least i have frenchx2 now instead of calc 12 followed by pre calc 12.
//for those of you who are curious about tophat turmoil(name still pending),
//first off, congratulations on uncovering my github account.
//i am workin on it currently. by it i mean the second prequel
//which is actually the middle game and oh hold on a second im using //s
/*ahh, that's much better. i actually forgot the art of commenting, heh.
  anyways, the progress is completely stalled. i just cant seem to want to do anything.
  i gotta finish the special moves mechanic and make the test level more
  polished and make a better character select than just typing in chat and
  make testbot actually capable of hurting the player and so many gui things
  and i got school and rest of real life and stuff and now the phestival
  
  yow. i kinda just let it out huh. i hope my yap will be more organized later
  
  my back #^$#$^@*& hurts from standing for almost 5 hours straight.
  
  waaaaah i didnt get to play the phestival today because i was too busy procrastinating
  man i suck at life. maybe i should just k- âš¡ (no unicode in processing? unifont fixed that?)
