<div><h4>21(AAAHHHH)st of March, 2025</h4>
So, this is the blog that i was gonna make eventually. Cool, i was gettin bored of writin in that .pde file anyways cause it opens in processing by default and im too lazy to open it in notepad. who knows, maybe one day im gonna make some aspen or php or whatever those autogenerating html files are so that i can keep this home page nice and tidy. that would be cool and i would have to learn another programmin language to complement the ones that i know already (of which only java is the useful one) and i wont have to copy paste the formatting from an html file to make a new one in that style. anyways back to the yapping. i am not even close to finishing tophat turmoil (the roblox one, henceforth called bloxhat turmoil) because im lazy and i code slowly when im bored (which is always). im too busy tryna get my "beloved" c202s to run windows to go anyways. its already strugglin to run linux with its measly 16 gb of storage that rivals my iphone 4s and its lovely 2 gb of ram that is a whole 2x the size of my d260. at least the d260 is able to boot into windows xp and has 10 times the storage while i have to use an sd card that pops out with a slight bump on the chromebook to store more than just my repository on it. maybe i should just use freedos and remove all networking and mouse capabilities of it but be able to have a whoppin 14 gb of free space for dos things like windows 95 or doom or microsoft word version 6. but i would probably have to reflash the bios of the chromebook to enable legacy boot so bleh. im probably gonna make some better css eventually to make it look on par with the phighting page. speakin of which i havent even set this up correctly to let the phighting page coexist with this one yet.<br>
i was just goin through my roblox photos and oh boy the memories in there. though i just wanna show some ones i think are cool.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20201123_094426300.png" alt="Me in Roblox Pizza Tycoon holding a pizza with the text 'Serve this Poison to a customer' on the screen." title="This is the photo of All Time"><br>
this be that ever iconic shot of me delivering Poison to a customer in pizza tycoon way back in 2020. i do believe that i had some older ones but they were wiped when i upgraded my office pc from a hard drive to an ssd and did not know to just reinstall windows on the ssd to keep all the data on the hard drive and a have a fast boot drive mostly free from garbage. oh well if i find those older pics ill probably show some here.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20220221_203539274.png" alt="Me in Roblox Bee Swarm Simulator standing in the Pumpkin Field. The quest menu includes 'Collect 100 Snowflake Tokens 69/100'." title="As you can see from the Bubble Bee Man Mask, I'm a Bee Swarm OG."><br>
heres the earliest picture of bee swarm that i could find. i have not progressed much past this cause i stopped playin bee swarm around this time but just today i finally defeated the stupid coconut crab. the whole reason i took this photo is probably cause of the amount of snowflakes that i had obtained for snowbear showdown. i was quite immature back then. not sayin that im not now though.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20220319_182453830.png" alt="Me in Roblox Labor Island Tycoon looking at text that reads 'players can steal your cash'." title="Ah, the dream of cheaply outsourcing labour to make maximum profits."><br>
this is photo evidence of me bein caught red handed runnin a child labour factory (in roblox just in case someone wants to take me to court over that statement out of context) and i am exploiting a bug to grind rebirths (explanation below) because i wanted to get the nuke. i could have just searched up a youtube video of it but i guess i wanted one for myself. then the game got taken down forever before i could get enough rebirths. now for that explanation: basically when you rebirth it deletes everything that you bought and restores the buttons but the dev forgot to also reset the money in the collector thingy so when i rebirthed i could simply go back to the same spot and "steal" the money that was left so i could simply start with enough cash to complete the tycoon again. the collector does reset if you claim the tycoon though but that aint important cause you cant even play the game anymore.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20220531_161758998.png" alt="Me in Roblox Sonic Speed Simulator. The HUD at the top of the screen includes the text '960,960 STEPS'." title="Back in my day I only got 1 lag spike per minute in SSS"><br>
heres me in classic sonic speed simulator, before the extremely aggressive child casino tactics were deployed, and as you can barely see on the top i am clearly a true sonic fan since i play the roblox game so much and not actual sonic games (although the only one i had at the time was forces) and i have 960*1001 steps.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20221013_164704218.png" alt="The Store Options screen in Roblox Retail Tycoon 2. Decoration, Shelter, Queue Sizes and Cleanliness are all at 5 stars while the 5th star of Crowdedness is 9/10 filled." title="What do you want me to do, kick everyone out of the store?"><br>
this is where the whole stuff n stuff thing comes from. after gettin bored of retail tycoon the original years ago, i made a new shop in retail tycoon 2, and here you can see that i have 4.98 stars with the goofiest layout of random plants and just slightly too much crowdedness.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20230215_153302878.png" alt="Me in Roblox PHIGHTING!. The end-of-game scoreboard is heavily lopsided to blue's favour, while I'm at the top of the red team. The kill counts for all other members of my team are 8, 7, 0 and 3, while my assists count is 22." title="So this is how I managed to get a 1:2:4 Kills:Deaths:Assists ratio."><br>
here's a pic of me when i was happy. i just wanna say, I MEOWIN MISS OLD MEDKIT SO MUCH MY AIM SUCKS I NEED THE STUPID FULL AUTO SYRINGE GUN<br>
anyways if you look closely at the leaderboards you can see that not only did i bowl an absolute horrible game as medkit but i also have 6 more assists than the combined kills of my teammates. this is that old medkit assists bug (although other healin characters like boombox (technically) probably also had it) where if a medkit healed a teammate, it counted as an assist, and if that phighter then died, the medkit would recieve an assist (although i believe without the visual cue). this reminds me of that one game where i failed so hard that i got 40 assists. this is why i dont play phighting its because i suck.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20230705_175450327.png" alt="Me in Roblox PHIGHTING!. I am on top of a star-like object in the intermission lobby." title="Someone doesn't like Singapore"><br>
note that its technically the 22(AAAHHHH)nd of march now but im not gonna make a new horiz rule or anything just pretend its still the 21(AAAHHHH)st. this is me after i was happy, i.e. when i was sad. note how i only have 6 bullets in this screenshot while i had 20 in the previous one. look how they massacred my boy. i know that there is now vine staff but its not the same because i cant just shoot everything and hope it turns out ok anymore i actually have to try and think. now im not sayin that it aint fun but i liked old medkit. i can just imagine on april fools day phighting reverts back to the og one from before i played it when there was only sword rocket slingy boomboy and meddy and theyre all their og kits and not their new ones. that would be kinda funny. but then again that fnaf map was pretty fire
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240309_154029725.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator. The leaderboard states that I have 245 Coins and 245 Floors. There is an ongoing conversation between Infected, who is saying 'ZOMG! 0_0 d0 U liek to p4rtY!?1' with PartyNoob responding with 'yea!'." title="The start of an addiction."><br>
this is the earliest regretevator image that i have i think. note the floors and coins. not only are they equal which is cool but note those numbers for later cause theyll be very important for the photos later. i should make a yap about which characters i like and why someday but that day is not today (which is still definitely the 21(AAAHHHH)st). it may be tomorrow, or later, or even never if i forget about it (which i probably will within a day or two) but thats for later.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240310_161942359.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator looking at the Changelog Highlights, which states that the date is '03/09/2004', and that the 'prototype is here'." title="and the world was never the same."><br>
this is back when the (literally) meowin proto got added to the game. i thought it was cool until i found out that i needed to play in a public server to finish the tiles thing because this was new and i had zero clue about how it worked.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240310_214605333.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator looking at 'GoldenReddy' who is saying 'Have a RED-RED-REDTASTIC day!'. The leaderboard states that I have 1,730 Coins and 596 Floors." title="I sure hope he doesn't bite, especially not in 1987"><br>
this is golden reddy. now the subject of this photo is not of much importance other than bein golden reddy but if you look at the filename for this pic it was taken on the same day as the previous photo and only one day after that first regretty pic. now note the coins and floors. they have increased quite a concerning amount in a single day, and keep in mind that this was only floor 15 on this day. i actually have no idea how i grinded so many floors like that but i dont care much. on second inspection i seem to have restarted the private server cause the previous one shows floor 74 and im the only one in the chat dying. those were the golden days of my regretty addiction.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240313_185114658.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator holding the Red Teddy item. The chat includes '[Dev][CatJam]: fun fact the yellow item is all the devs of the game saying &quot;yellow&quot;'." title="I wonder what those silly little icons in the bottom left mean."><br>
heres me with one of the devs of the game. apparently the coolio toolio is voiced by all the devs of regretty. thats cool.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240313_190301567.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator on the disco floor. I have made a bug report." title="I wonder if I ruined the fun. At least there are 2 devs in the game?"><br>
and heres me bein very not cool cause in the chat you can see me reporting a bug (and a very broken one at that!) to the dev but you know what? if i encounter a bug and i get a chance to report it, i will. i hate bugs in my code, and im sure that most other people (includin the dev here) hate them too. if you didnt know, the bug makes all effects null and void, so you can jermpop without the health gain and get the 1.5x coins of the cursed orb whatever (forgot the name) without the crazy health loss. and also you can just simply walk over banana peels and they can only make you jump.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240313_192251091.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator on the Rokea floor. Lampert has been found in 7.06 seconds according to my stopwatch." title="I hate nighttime in Rokea"><br>
and this is a very fast lampert finding, which is apparently a new record, but as you can see in the next one here...
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240314_192511628.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator on the Rokea floor. Lampert has been found in 4.63 seconds according to my stopwatch." title="but I do like daytime in Rokea"><br>
...it is clearly not anymore if it was one in the first place. fun fact, i had lampert literally spawn right in front of me once but i got stuck on a shelf which whittled my time from a 1 second to a 7 or more second one. i should upload my regretevator videos sometime. i have like several days worth of videos i think.<br>
<br>
but anyways i think thats it for today's rant, kitta's been askin me to work for about an hour now so i gotta go. bye.<br>
p.s. i just reloaded the page for the first time after adding the images and i gotta fix that scaling sometime soon. the images may look fine at a larger than 1080p resolution or a smaller zoom level but they certainly dont look too fine to me. also im goin straight to sleep without workin so sorry kitta.
</div>

<div><h4>23rd of March, 2025</h4>
i dont know why im writing that date that fancy way but whatever. today i yap about them regretevator characters. note that my knowledge is gonna be a little outdated cause i dont play regretevator much anymore so yeah.<br>
startin off with my favourite party dingus its poob. poob is very cool. he's just so happy all the time. and cute<br>
note that im not gonna follow a specific order its just whomever i think of next<br>
wallter and mannequinmark were lovers i think but then they broke up. i dont know the lore behind it but its probably too deep for me. i like wallter more though cause even though nowadays you can get a free hat from mark wallter is easier to stand on. and im on team concrete cause it doesnt rot makin it last longer. plus you can recycle it probably by crushing it back to powder and usin that instead of fresh rock when makin new concrete.<br>
prototype and scag are the only robots in the game that i like. mostly cause theyre the only sentient ones but i actually am clueless about how scag is sentient cause bro's a crt. i know of another sentient crt from somewhere else but unless they're modded with npu's and whatnot they cant be sentient cause theyre tv's. unless scag is remote controlled which actually kinda makes sense. what if scag the tv was just remote controlled and the real scag is a computer hidden somewhere in the floppy shoppy. call me matpat (or rather tom or whoevers hostin gt nowadays) cause i got a game theory.<br>
now onto the other robot, or robots rather, its reddy and the red ball band i think theyre called. i dont like them. theyre just kinda boring. at least reddy can dispense free green healing balls whenever you give them flowers.<br>
i wonder if lampert is a robot too, cause one of the old fanarts in the lobby depict lampert with a robotic body instead of the plain white one that he has in the game. though i think he has dreams according to folly so probably not. lampert is kinda chill too he's just antisocial like me.<br>
anyways the way i remember folly is she's the one who allows me to finish the jump # times challenge much easier because the gap between the floor and her "part" is just slightly taller than me allowing me to jump a very large amount of times in a second even though the challenge only registers like 2 out of 5 jumps. she also has a cool boss fight, so cool i cant even remember how she appeared in the elevator before that got added, although i think that she just appeared if there was an empty space.<br>
for infected vs unpleasant, i must say im on team unpleasant. bro's so chill just standing there, and on the shoplifting floor when the lights turn red the gradient is so cool. infected i started hating for literally no reason even before the update where he could sneeze and turn something infected. maybe its because of the sneezing.<br>
i remember the good old days when stat used to spawn on that apartment neurotoxin floor. the floor's really easy if you have your volume set to high cause you can literally just hear the music through the door, and you can even camera clip with shiftlock to hear inside. now stats got her own cool boss fight that i think is actually more peak than follys because instead of surviving then standing on a pedestal numerous times you have to run around destroying lazer lamp posts with robots and turrets connected to them so that you can star platnium special/vanilla ice special the generator numerous times.
i was gonna say that that fight is the only one that consistently gets me to use chezburgers but i just remembered how they nerfed the medkit. like COMEON YOU GOTTA NERF MEDKIT EVEN IN A CROSS OVER WHAT THE MEOW<br>
methinks split is cool. the jokes may be stupid but they are at least better than my meow/nya puns, like mine are nyawful, meowin not funnya, very lameow. nyanyways, split lobs banana peels. that is funny especially when i can chain 3 banana peels and be stunlocked in bananas.<br>
and thinkin of split made me think of that one game thumbnail with the most bizarre depiction of prototype that i have ever seen, like proto looks more like rat from fnac 3 than proto. i think its the face, or the body shape, but its definitely the mouth cause why does proto have fangs???<br>
pest speaks japanese. i speak japanese. so im gonna write this part in the most broken japanese youve ever seen. ペストは本当うるさい人です。彼はゲストの服を着る、だからちょっとかっこいいです、でも彼はコインを奪う、だから俺は彼を好かない。そのようの人がいつも好かないと思う。＜ビ・アル＞<br>
and i cant forget the cats (even though i just did) because i love cats. i meowin love cats.<br>
dr retro is my most favourite one, although i dont like it when she obliterates elevator npcs until there are 2 spots open when she arrives. like what if you kill poob? that's unforgivable.<br>
and then there's gnarps. i dont like gnarps very much even though i call gnarpy gnarps instead of gnarpy. gnarpy has a lazer blaster now and i think thats cool cause it fits with the constant threats of zapper annihilation. though i liked gnarps' older design better cause its just more cute. the big bushy tail, the glowy star, the slight tufts of fur, meowity meow its better than double of everything gnarpy.<br>
right i forgot the other robot melanie. im pretty meowin sure she's a robot cause she got that glitch stutter, a screen face that was bein used as a display by mozelle at one point, and the cutesy bitcrushed speech sound effect like proto's bitcrushed meow. she got that free double jump them bunny ears and thats pretty much it.<br>
ive played regretty a few days ago cause of the stupid mega hunt whatever and i found out that pilby spawns when death is selected on the wheel thingy so maybe pilby spawns no matter what is chosen (except for reroll) now. thats cool.<br>
im runnin out of characters that i can remember but i do remember mozelle. the -q-u-e-e-n- _princess_ that likes strawberries. also i can get negative scores in that minigame in her castle.<br>
spudsy spud. spud SPUD spud. spud spUD cool spud.<br>
its criminal putting bive so far after split. i know bive for how many meowin times their voice clip changed. and also bivekit.<br>
i have been listening to my new song piecey peace for so long now its crazy. i meowin love this song even though its short (although a minute by my song standards is long) mainly cause i have this crazy new fm drumset that ive made that sounds really like samples. you all know i think that fm drums are more impressive than sampled drums and that i like them more <h6>definitely not because i dont own drums to sample and i feel like stealing if i use someone else's samples</h6>and i really like my new drums. to think that i actually have musical talent is nuts cause all my other songs suck.<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/piecey_peace.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
sorry your browser dont got mp3 support somehow<br>
</audio>
heres a heavily compressed version (although it sure aint the most compressed i can make it... smiles in opus) that i made cause its tiny. half a megabyte for a 50 somethin second single loop no fadeout clip of my song. if i can learn how to make loopin mp3s i just have to loop it at 1.066 seconds to loop it perfectly.<br>
anyways i think im out of regretevator characters i probably forgot some but i was only talkin about elevator npcs so dinguses like emphonso gregoriah and JumboJoe arent here on purpose. anyways i dont got more to yap about cause i got more game development stuff so i gotta go. bye.<br>
p.s. meowity meow is like my catchphrase at this point
</div>

<div><h3>My meowin chromebook.</h3>
<h4>23rd of March, 2025</h4>
ok so im back from tryna do the impossible and run windows to go on a chromebook. its just straight up impossible probably cause i tried bootin the usb version (the one it was designed for) and it said that it couldnt run on my system. oh well, back to lookin for more linuxes. ive used q4os already and its nice if it didnt take up like 10 gb to install the trinity desktop with minimal things. after i got some of my other stuff on it like git and my repo i couldnt even install wine cause i had too low disk space. at this point i might as well just use arch linux and hope that it takes like 3 gb and nothing more. or just give up on gui applications and suffer in command line cause i cant use many apps like furnace and basically any windows application. and i am NEVER GOING BACK TO CHROMEOS I WANT TO KEEP MY FILES WHEN THERES NO SPACE LEFT IN THE 2GB THAT IT GIVES ME. like i know its a netbook and all but my meowin windows xp netbook from 2010 is miles better than the chromebook. even though all of its components are roughly half the power of the chromebook it still runs much better, and can even play lego star wars, which probably wont even install on the chromebook due to the storage. and i can run windows 1.01 on xp so its clear who's the winner here. nyanyways i dont got more to yap about my chromebook other than it sucks and i wish it were upgradable cause i would deck the meow out of it. i really gotta make more bloxhat turmoil so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i wanna make every single ending bit of these posts to be the same cause that would be cool.
</div>

<div><h3>The current state of Tophat Turmoil</h3>
<h4>24th of March, 2025 (forgot the date, oops :3)</h4>
I was talkin with Kitta the other day and we've determined that I hate workin because I'm impatient and want instant results without any wait. makes sense to me so what do I do now? write a blog post about tophat turmoil instead of workin on it of course. technically this takes lots of time and gives back something for it. i dont know what it gives but im sure its at least somethin. anyways currently tophat turmoil is open cause i really dont care about random people testin it out, but like who would even do such a thing anyway. the game that you are teleported to when you press play is the "hub" place, which is currently a button that takes up the entire screen and teleports you to the testin realm, which currently consists of unfinished rhythmgunner and speedshooter and 2 buttons that summon 2 snowmen and a slow snowman respectively. ive coded a thing which lets me add more characters easier but im not gonna. i actually dont know why im not gonna now that i think about it.<br>
ive just looked through the anylitics of my experience and to my surprise 2 unique people have played my game as you can see in this photo:
<img src="pics/Screenshot_24-3-2025_23205_create.roblox.com.jpeg" alt="Text reading &quot;New users 2 (up arrow)206.6%&quot;" title="I'm so proud.">
I have no idea how roblox calculates increase here because how the meow does one get such a specific percentage for this scale of growth. did i have like a fraction of a player before? like just the finger of a person plays? but whatever. whats funny is this photo:
<img src="pics/Screenshot_24-3-2025_231837_create.roblox.com.jpeg" alt="Text reading &quot;Returning users 0 (up arrow)2.6%&quot;" title="At this point it just looks like Roblox is trying to gaslight me.">
like how the heck is 0 players an increase like what is it increasing from. how can i possibly have had less than 0 recurring users like do they travel back in time to stop themselves from playing the game??? and again with the incredibly specific percentage??? and that was just the impressions by source. this is the plays by source:
<img src="pics/Screenshot_24-3-2025_232829_create.roblox.com.jpeg" alt="Text reading &quot;New users 0 Returning users 0 (up arrow)24.2%&quot;" title="At least it's in the green.">
At least there's no growth percentage on new users but how is there so much on returning users??? how many fingers travelled back in time for this one???<br>
i would yap on about more of the statistics like daily active users growing by 38% to a grand total of zero but i think i should yap more about tophat turmoil now. the game is kinda working but i have yet to add in a bunch of features cause i just am not tryna think of new features. i should probably do that soon. now im trying to code speedshooter so that he lives up to his name, specifically the speed part. and no, he's a robot so im pretty sure he cant do speed but he can have a lot of speed. here's an exerpt of what ive written today in the onenote notebook for the moves and such:
<h6>For every chained enemy Speedshooter's attacks hit, Speedshooter gains 1 volt, which boosts his speed by 0.1 Walkspeed. He can hold up to 100 Volts.</h6>
that's right, not only does he have the joe suter technique (m2) but now he has a passive speed boost for every chain from his vast arsenal of annoying chain attacks. good thing im makin a pve currently but when i start makin tophat tournament its gonna be either super broken or super meh. i might as well make a table here of the attacks that the characters currently have just cause i havent implemented the character select screen's descriptions yet.

</table>
and before i move on to speedshooters attacks im gonna explain some things. first is quite obvious, i havent formatted the table yet so there arent any borders which means the descriptions look like one long paragraph. im gonna fix that later promise. second the descriptions are pulled straight from the onenote notebook because i thought it would be cool for all you fans, all 0 of you. and lastly F+ is in fact NOT the grade that i got at school, as how the heck do you fail +, is that more than a 0 or a negative grade? anyways F+ is the "cool" whatever ultimate thingamabob. so basically some ults in my game (all of them at the current moment) have a second stage, like a retrigger super in a fighting game. you just tap f again in a certain interval and it improves the ult at the cost of another charge of the ult meter. also speakin of fighting games im plannin on makin darkitta use fighting game movements like half circles dragon punches etc but instead of something like
<h6> B,DB,D,DF,F + P (fighting game notation)</h6>
its gonna be more like
<h6> S, S+D, D, D+W, W + M1 (keyboard mouse notation)</h6>
which is gonna be so fun i bet. leagues better than "kitty curse" which is another game i _was_ workin on that ive lost interest in (and cause i have no time for it) which had stupid mouse flicks and mouse button holds (which were not even coded into the game i stopped workin on it after like a day) which are not very cool. anyways where was i?

when i say i copy pasted from the notebook i meant copy pasted from the note book. the m1 for speedshooter has incorrect damage (as of this game version) in the description cause i havent updated the notebook yet. and i refuse to do it here. also i lied about all ults having ult pluses. i lied. by the way heres the volts description from speedys main page:
<h6>For every chained enemy Speedshooter's attacks hit, Speedshooter gains 1 volt, which boosts his speed by 0.1 Walkspeed. He can hold up to 100 Volts.</h6>
Also volt charge is only up to 10 times cause any more than that and it would be too op. and it also persists after death too. actually now that i think about it you lose 10 volts every time you die. balancing.<br>
nyanyways now i got rhythmgunner speedshooter kitta and darkitta tellin me to stop yapping and start coding so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. funny bit of trivia adoctoriam was made in a little doodle, same as gwentwin. although im pretty sure ive spilled the beans on that earlier at some point. also speedy's volts are now bolts cause i keep forgetting.

<h4>26th of March, 2025</h4>
first of all, before i get into the yappin, there are a couple of things i gotta pre-yap about. first of all i should get a new keyboard, cause i think that this one that im typin on is probably actually older than me so i gotta get one thats even older so i can use the magic of the ps/2 connector for better key rollover (i mean like this one has 2 key rollover, i cant even press w e and d at the same time to interact while moving forwards and right) or one thats new and probably garbage. also, you may notice that my github profile pic is tiled in the background (or  just one if your window/screen is square enough), and also the background behind this text is now slightly (and i mean slightly!) transparent. i was gonna make kittas picture the background but i feel like "=3.png" fits better. also this yap will have accompanying music to play as you read, almost like a youtube yap video. of course the choice is yours to actually play it or play it in order but whatever.

i like music. i also like making music. this music was made by me some time ago. i am also typing in a very weird manner. i shall stop now.<br>
music is like one of the big 4 things in my life, the other 3 being kitta, game development and game playing. of course i have other interests but these are my main 4. its so big that i waste about 15 minutes on average per day clicking the random button in foobar2000 for a music track that i like at that current moment so that i can work for another minute or an hour without changing it. i actually have no idea how much time i spend doing that though thats just an estimate. sometimes i hear a music that i like so much that its the only thing i listen to for a few days.
<br>
its a couple of days later and i dont wanna yap about music anymore. but i still wanna yap so for this post i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i practically exclusively listen to chiptunes

<div><h3>Windows Vista's Style</h3>
<h4>28th of March, 2025</h4>
I was browsin the settings of retrobar when i thought i would try the windows vista start bar. and that got me thinkin, windows vista is cool. so i decided to skin my windows 11 installation as windows vista. the transparency is so cool. and the title bar buttons bring me back to when i used to use windows vista because i had an installation dvd for it. or rather have cause i still have it.
<img src="pics/Screenshot 2025-03-28 165259.png" alt="foobar2000 with the Windows Vista style window decorations" title="So meowin' cool...">
just look at foobar2000 in this style this is peak design. and they gradually butchered it more and more after 7 until windows 11 where they reintroduced rounded window corners, and i would be okay with those IF THEY DIDNT CROP CONTENT WHY HAVE IT CUT OFF IF ITS STILL USED like its so stupid. which is why i downloaded that windows 11 no rounded corners patch but now i dont need it cause the window borders are rounded but not the actual window content. what also makes me angry is how incomprehensibly and ridiculously difficult it was to do all this because<br>
i had to search up and download a transformation pack which finished downloading after around 10 minutes<br>
i had to manually download all of the customization stuff because the pack only contained links to the stuff that actually makes it work<br>
i was trying to use dwmblurglass but every time roblox studio started it destroyed the transparency which meant i had to reapply the transparency<br>
the window border width kept changing between the windows vista and windows 11 widths until i used 4 different patches to fix it<br>
i installed mica for everyone which probably did nothing but might have something to do with the border widths<br>
i installed openglass which is practically undocumented on the github and was left clueless until i found a video<br>
and i tried using aero window manager but that only works for windows 10 so i had to still use dwmblurglass for the window control button sizes which arent even vista.<br>
in all this took me a day to get workin properly but its worth it cause instead of usin my vista vm or installin it on my real hardware i can just make windows 11 look practically exactly like windows vista. i mean the retrobar fonts and systray icons arent correct and the taskbar isnt even transparent but its nice enough for me. and i have all the system icons and sounds matched practically exactly except some sounds didnt exist in vista so i just improvised.<br>
nyow there are downsides like the start menu not being like the classic one and having the apps list go outside of the start menu since i have a metric ton of apps and i havent rebooted my pc yet after doin all the patches so i have no idea if they will stay or not. and i dont have the widgets cause i never see my desktop anyways. and the privacy concerns with the window decorations bein transparent are existant even though they are little to none. but hey, i get transparency in the uwp notepad's everything. literally everything except the background is transparent.
welp, i got nothin more to write about so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. im definitely not gonna get enamoured by the windows xp style, then windows 2000, then 95/98, then 3.1, then 3.0 then ms dos. the reason for that is that i have my windows xp laptop right next to me and i can drool over that instead of doin all this stuff for windows 11 again
