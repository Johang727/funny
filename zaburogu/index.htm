<div><h4>21(AAAHHHH)st of March, 2025</h4>
So, this is the blog that i was gonna make eventually. Cool, i was gettin bored of writin in that .pde file anyways cause it opens in processing by default and im too lazy to open it in notepad. who knows, maybe one day im gonna make some aspen or php or whatever those autogenerating html files are so that i can keep this home page nice and tidy. that would be cool and i would have to learn another programmin language to complement the ones that i know already (of which only java is the useful one) and i wont have to copy paste the formatting from an html file to make a new one in that style. anyways back to the yapping. i am not even close to finishing tophat turmoil (the roblox one, henceforth called bloxhat turmoil) because im lazy and i code slowly when im bored (which is always). im too busy tryna get my "beloved" c202s to run windows to go anyways. its already strugglin to run linux with its measly 16 gb of storage that rivals my iphone 4s and its lovely 2 gb of ram that is a whole 2x the size of my d260. at least the d260 is able to boot into windows xp and has 10 times the storage while i have to use an sd card that pops out with a slight bump on the chromebook to store more than just my repository on it. maybe i should just use freedos and remove all networking and mouse capabilities of it but be able to have a whoppin 14 gb of free space for dos things like windows 95 or doom or microsoft word version 6. but i would probably have to reflash the bios of the chromebook to enable legacy boot so bleh. im probably gonna make some better css eventually to make it look on par with the phighting page. speakin of which i havent even set this up correctly to let the phighting page coexist with this one yet.<br>
i was just goin through my roblox photos and oh boy the memories in there. though i just wanna show some ones i think are cool.

this be that ever iconic shot of me delivering Poison to a customer in pizza tycoon way back in 2020. i do believe that i had some older ones but they were wiped when i upgraded my office pc from a hard drive to an ssd and did not know to just reinstall windows on the ssd to keep all the data on the hard drive and a have a fast boot drive mostly free from garbage. oh well if i find those older pics ill probably show some here.<br>

heres the earliest picture of bee swarm that i could find. i have not progressed much past this cause i stopped playin bee swarm around this time but just today i finally defeated the stupid coconut crab. the whole reason i took this photo is probably cause of the amount of snowflakes that i had obtained for snowbear showdown. i was quite immature back then. not sayin that im not now though.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20220319_182453830.png"><br>
this is photo evidence of me bein caught red handed runnin a child labour factory (in roblox just in case someone wants to take me to court over that statement out of context) and i am exploiting a bug to grind rebirths (explanation below) because i wanted to get the nuke. i could have just searched up a youtube video of it but i guess i wanted one for myself. then the game got taken down forever before i could get enough rebirths. now for that explanation: basically when you rebirth it deletes everything that you bought and restores the buttons but the dev forgot to also reset the money in the collector thingy so when i rebirthed i could simply go back to the same spot and "steal" the money that was left so i could simply start with enough cash to complete the tycoon again. the collector does reset if you claim the tycoon though but that aint important cause you cant even play the game anymore.

heres me in classic sonic speed simulator, before the extremely aggressive child casino tactics were deployed, and as you can barely see on the top i am clearly a true sonic fan since i play the roblox game so much and not actual sonic games (although the only one i had at the time was forces) and i have 960*1001 steps.

this is where the whole stuff n stuff thing comes from. after gettin bored of retail tycoon the original years ago, i made a new shop in retail tycoon 2, and here you can see that i have 4.98 stars with the goofiest layout of random plants and just slightly too much crowdedness.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20230215_153302878.png"><br>
here's a pic of me when i was happy. i just wanna say, I MEOWIN MISS OLD MEDKIT SO MUCH MY AIM SUCKS I NEED THE STUPID FULL AUTO SYRINGE GUN<br>
anyways if you look closely at the leaderboards you can see that not only did i bowl an absolute horrible game as medkit but i also have 4 more assists than the combined kills of my teammates. this is that old medkit assists bug (although other healin characters like boombox (technically) probably also had it) where if a medkit healed a teammate, it counted as an assist, and if that phighter then died, the medkit would recieve an assist (although i believe without the visual cue). this reminds me of that one game where i failed so hard that i got 40 assists. this is why i dont play phighting its because i suck.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20230705_175450327.png"><br>
note that its technically the 22(AAAHHHH)nd of march now but im not gonna make a new horiz rule or anything just pretend its still the 21(AAAHHHH)st. this is me after i was happy, i.e. when i was sad. note how i only have 6 bullets in this screenshot while i had 20 in the previous one. look how they massacred my boy. i know that there is now vine staff but its not the same because i cant just shoot everything and hope it turns out ok anymore i actually have to try and think. now im not sayin that it aint fun but i liked old medkit. i can just imagine on april fools day phighting reverts back to the og one from before i played it when there was only sword rocket slingy boomboy and meddy and theyre all their og kits and not their new ones. that would be kinda funny. but then again that fnaf map was pretty fire

this is the earliest regretevator image that i have i think. note the floors and coins. not only are they equal which is cool but note those numbers for later cause theyll be very important for the photos later. i should make a yap about which characters i like and why someday but that day is not today (which is still definitely the 21(AAAHHHH)st). it may be tomorrow, or later, or even never if i forget about it (which i probably will within a day or two) but thats for later.

this is back when the (literally) meowin proto got added to the game. i thought it was cool until i found out that i needed to play in a public server to finish the tiles thing because this was new and i had zero clue about how it worked.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240310_214605333.png"><br>
this is golden reddy. now the subject of this photo is not of much importance other than bein golden reddy but if you look at the filename for this pic it was taken on the same day as the previous photo and only one day after that first regretty pic. now note the coins and floors. they have increased quite a concerning amount in a single day, and keep in mind that this was only floor 15 on this day. i actually have no idea how i grinded so many floors like that but i dont care much. on second inspection i seem to have restarted the private server cause the previous one shows floor 74 and im the only one in the chat dying. those were the golden days of my regretty addiction.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240313_185114658.png"><br>
heres me with one of the devs of the game. apparently the coolio toolio is voiced by all the devs of regretty. thats cool.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240313_190301567.png"><br>
and heres me bein very not cool cause in the chat you can see me reporting a bug (and a very broken one at that!) to the dev but you know what? if i encounter a bug and i get a chance to report it, i will. i hate bugs in my code, and im sure that most other people (includin the dev here) hate them too. if you didnt know, the bug makes all effects null and void, so you can jermpop without the health gain and get the 1.5x coins of the cursed orb whatever (forgot the name) without the crazy health loss. and also you can just simply walk over banana peels and they can only make you jump.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240313_192251091.png"><br>
and this is a very fast lampert finding, which is apparently a new record, but as you can see in the next one here...
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240314_192511628.png"><br>
...it is clearly not anymore if it was one in the first place. fun fact, i had lampert literally spawn right in front of me once but i got stuck on a shelf which whittled my time from a 1 second to a 7 or more second one. i should upload my regretevator videos sometime. i have like several days worth of videos i think.<br>
<br>
but anyways i think thats it for today's rant, kitta's been askin me to work for about an hour now so i gotta go. bye.<br>
p.s. i just reloaded the page for the first time after adding the images and i gotta fix that scaling sometime soon. the images may look fine at a larger than 1080p resolution or a smaller zoom level but they certainly dont look too fine to me. also im goin straight to sleep without workin so sorry kitta.
