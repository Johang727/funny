Don't Steal My Songs!

On the main page of this repository (or the root folder) there is a list of all the music in this folder and who created them.
See all the ones that have only "Yoplar" in their authors? Those ones are ones made only by me. And I don't want anyone stealing them!
By putting my songs here on my repo, I am allowing you to download and listen to them for free.
I do not allow you to redistribute these songs as your songs that you created.
You may share them without credit, but if you do credit someone, credit me as I made them.
You can share these songs in any format. I don't care. Convert it to a midi or an mp3 all you want.
Burn them to a disk(as long as you don't sell it because that is literally just profiting off my work).

For the covers I made, credit the original song creators. I personally think that I don't deserve more credit for simply arranging songs.
The covers have the original song creators followed by a "cv. Yoplar" after.
And for the songs without any of that, they are not made by me in any way. Maybe converted, but not produced.
Bottom line, don't steal songs, it's not nice. I worked hard on my songs.
