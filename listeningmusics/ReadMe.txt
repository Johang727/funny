Don't Steal My Songs!

NOTE: this is outdated my songs are kaneko1 kaneko2 kittacatmeow kittheme muahaha ponger & too much stuff n stuff
all other songs are either covers i made of songs not by me or just other songs by people who are not me.
basically credit me please when using my songs if you choose to credit someone and if you use a cover or an other song
credit the original authors before me cause its their songs

Note: This does not apply to "Azure Temple.mid", "Armored Sensui.mid", "untitled.opus" and "يا طارشي.mid"; those songs are not mine.

By putting my songs here on my repo, I am allowing you to download and listen to them for free.
I do not allow you to redistribute these songs as your songs that you created.
You may share them without credit, but if you do credit someone, credit me as I made them.
The best way that you can share these songs is linking this repo and downloading them from that.

For STDFIGHT and TAKE YOUR TIME credit the original song creators (Noboru Yamane and Key After Key respectively).
I only made cover versions of those songs. If you wish to credit me, credit me as cover creator or cv. or something.
Now the VGMs have proper tags so refer to the tags for the original authors of the songs I made covers for.

Bottom line, don't steal songs, it's not nice. I worked hard on my songs.
