Don't Steal My Songs!

Note: This does not apply to "Azure Temple.mid", "untitled.opus" and "يا طارشي.mid"; those songs are not mine.

By putting my songs here on my repo, I am allowing you to download and listen to them for free.
I do not allow you to redistribute these songs as your songs that you created.
You may share them without credit, but if you do credit someone, credit me as I made them.
The best way that you can share these songs is linking this repo and downloading them from that.

For STDFIGHT and TAKE YOUR TIME credit the original song creators (Noboru Yamane and Key After Key respectively).
I only made cover versions of those songs. If you wish to credit me, credit me as cover creator or cv. or something.

Bottom line, don't steal songs, it's not nice. I worked hard on my songs.
