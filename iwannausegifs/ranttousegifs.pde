/* heyo, I just wanted to write more rants so bad that I made a file for
the next project before i was planning to work on it. classic me.
Anyways, you probably noticed that I'm writing in widescreen now, and
not only that, but I'm also using proper punctuation and captalization.
Don't worry, my trademark style of lazy writing will make its reappearance
in the next Talkument Yap file. But first, Last time on Talkument Yap:
I blabbered on about the origins of Speedshooter from my lovely game canon,
exclusively in French too. I wonder when the dub is gonna come out.
I also wrote a little tidbit about me getting a balisong comb, or a
combalisong as I like to call it. Finally, I alluded to the relationship
that Speedshooter is in with a certain cat. I suppose I will describe the
various relationships of Tophat Turmoil this time on Talkument Yap.
Oh, and feel free to skip to line 117 where the relationships end if you
don't want to see that stuff.

Part 1: Romances (Not only that, but actual yap organization? Fancy.)

Speedshooter x DarKitta
(P.S. I will write about DarKitta at a later date)
This is pretty much the first relationship that I thought up of for this
game's way-too-deep canon lore whatever. Without getting into spoilers for
the story of the games, basically [name TBD] here likes robots. They
fascinate him. He meets 2 such robots, Speedshooter and DarKitta. Then,
he wonders if those robots can feel love, so he asked them one day to both
play with him after school. After playing with them for a bit, he asked
them if they could feel love. Speedshooter and DarKitta both didn't know
because they never tried, so they got together and saw that they were
indeed programmed with the ability to feel love.
Cool, it's a robotic romance. Very nice.

Bassblaster x Snowballer
(P.S. I will also write about Bassblaster later)
This one is more subtle, as I never actually explicitly thought of this one
but what the heck, it's close enough. I will have to spoil a little bit of
the story for this one though. So, during the first game story, Bassblaster
picks up his car from the impound and starts driving to the Big Mall. On
the way, he spots Snowballer and [name TBD] skating down the highway. He
convinces them to ride with him over to the mall, and then when they get
there, they fight a bunch of Enemies, and then after the events of the
first game, they keep in touch, and even more so after the second game.
Umm, so maybe not really a relationship? I probably gotta develop it more.

Part 2: Friendships

Rhythmgunner, Speedshooter & Bassblaster
This is the original trio for this game, basically. Rather, they are the
first 3 of the original 5 characters that I stuck with for the first few
bits of this game's lore's lifespan. Rhythmgunner is good friends with
Bassblaster because of their musical exploits, Rhythmgunner & Speedshooter
are good friends due to a reason expained in the last Talkument Yap, and
Speedshooter and Bassblaster are friends due to their mutual friendship to
Rhythmgunner.

Speedshooter, [name TBD] & DarKitta (when will I name [name TBD] i wonder)
These 3 all like each other due to [name TBD]'s fascination with robots.

Snowballer & Gwentwin Spiritus
(bla bla Quentwin Corpus & Gwentwin Spiritus COMMING SOON)
(also this origin story for Gwentwin might be offensive somehow, idk)
This is the spiritual bunch of the characters. Snowballer is a snow spirit
person thing, and Gwentwin is a ghost. They met in a forest one day when
Gwentwin was still Quentwin Spiritus, and then after spending lots of time
together Quentwin transitioned into Gwentwin. (is that how transitioning
works? I have no idea since I have no experience or any friends to discuss
this with)(also this is merely the original idea, it still can be changed)

[name TBD] & Quentwin Corpus
Quentwin was asked to look after [name TBD] in school, and this is what
results from it. While Snowballer & Gwentwin are chatting away at home,
Quentwin is busy making sure [name TBD] doesn't get into any trouble at
school. However, this means that they can play together at break and stuff.

Bassblaster & Firefighter
These 2 are childhood friends (I have just decided) that bonded over the
mutual love of carbonated drinks. Both of them know quite a lot about the
soda landscape of the city.

Part :3 Familial Ties

Snowballer & [name TBD]
Snowballer was shown the orphanage on her grand tour given by Gwentwin, and
she wondered what it would be like to have a child, so she adopted one.
That's right, [name TBD] is adopted.

Quentwin & Gwentwin (technically)
The twins are really two parts of a single person. The lore is that the
original boy Quentin got killed by electricity during an operation (that I
will detail on later) and got his spirit freed from his body, but then was
promptly revived by electricity, however without the spirit coming back to
the body. This resulted in 2 of the same boy, just in different forms.

Kitta & DarKitta (technically)
DarKitta was made as an evil version of Kitta, and as such, has an AI based
off of Kitta's AI, just not very evil since Evyle is not very
technologically capable of doing such a task. Basically, this means that
they technically count as sisters due to possessing the same-ish AI?

DarKitta & Evyle (technically)
Since Evyle made DarKitta, technically Evyle's a father.

Trickshotter & Blademaster (i need better names :sob:)
These 2 are brothers who are good at doing tricks with weaponary due to
them serving in the army in the Filler War (exactly what it sounds like).

Part 4: Rivalries

[name TBD] & his friend who writes
Wowies, it's a new character that I just thought of today on the walk home
for lunch. There's this other character in the same school class as
[name TBD] who loves to write as much as [name TBD] loves to draw.
They compete to show that their passion is superior to the other.

End Relationships

Yowf, that was way too much unnecessary lore, especially for a game that is
currently not even close to being finished. I'm gonna make a demo soon, I
swear. I just gotta make a map and some enemies and some kits and some UI s
Anyways, I forgot to mention in the previous Talkument Yap that
Speedshooter writes his memoires a lot and it is very long.
Also, did you know that Talkument Yap is a funny based off Dragon Ball Z?
I mean the name. The name is based off of Dragon Ball Z.
