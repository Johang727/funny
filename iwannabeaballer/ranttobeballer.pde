 no, the talkument. yes, i think i like that.
 this is my solution to cleaning up my code.
 i just move my endless stream of blabbering
 into this seperate text document.
 the more im bored the larger this will be.
 i wonder how much this will inflate?
 
 Also, enjoy the new title block?
 I whipped it up in 1 minute just for this.
 
 Yay, first rant part.
 I am not a good coder.
 Sure, if you compare me to the average person
 I may seem decent, maybe even good at coding.
 However, honestly I should be shot for how I code.
 Sure, I can make some cool stuff,
 like the square colour tunnel thing,
 but my code is so horrendously organized,
 overinflated, overly optimized for the
 target platform, just so much wrong with it.
 And before you say
 "oh, you're just learning, you'll get better"
 I have been coding for more than half my life
 and I still code like this.
 Granted, it is only my 2nd year of Java
 and I coded mainly in assembly language before,
 (not to mention block based languages)
 but still, I should have the general style down.
 And also, I only know 5(text)programming languages.
 Further, 2 of them are assembly languages,
 which have practically no use to me.
 I mean, they're fun, but quite useless.
 I should really try harder to code better.
 Maybe I should get someone to show me
 how it actually is done someday.
